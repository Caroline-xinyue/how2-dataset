## The How2 Challenge: New Tasks for Vision & Language 

### Description
Research at the intersection of vision and language has been attracting a lot of attention in recent years. Research topics include the study of multi-modal representations, translation between modalities, bootstrapping of labels from one modality into another, visually-grounded question answering, segmentation and storytelling, and grounding the meaning of language in visual data. An ever-increasing number of tasks and datasets are appearing around this
recently-established field, and.

At NeurIPS 2018, we released the How2 data-set, containing 85,000 (2000h) of how-to videos, with audio, sub-titles, translations, and textual summaries, making it an ideal resource to bring together researchers working on these separate tasks. We hope that a common dataset will facilitate comparisons of tools and algorithms, and foster collaboration. We also presented challenge baseline results on three tasks: multi-modal machine translation, speech recognition, and video
summarization. This dataset and the challenge tasks are an outcome of a multi-site collaboration during the Fifth Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop on Grounded Sequence-to-Sequence transduction.

A workshop on learning from multimodal data touches on many issues that are at the core of ICML and NeurIPS, as shown by a number of recent workshops. In addition to inviting researchers to develop models that can simultaneously solve multiple tasks in multiple modalities, we aim to stimulate discussion around new tasks that go beyond image captioning and visual question answering, and which could form the crystallization nucleus for future research in this area.

The How2 data-set has already been released, and several groups aside from the proposers have actively started to explore its tasks. We are ready to publish a call for participation to a focused group and the wider community, and will work to organize a workshop that allows for both the publication of novel work that is relevant to the topics of discussion, and discussion of late-breaking results on the How2 tasks in a single format.

The workshop is a good for ICML considering the fundamental questions that it is trying to answer, and the variety of machine learning challenges they pose. We seek to create a venue to encourage collaboration between different sub-fields, and help establish new research directions and collaborations that we believe will sustain machine learning research for years to come. 

### Planned Activities (Tentative)
1. A series of presentations on the How2 Challenge Tasks, based on invited papers  
2. Posters from How2 challenge participants to encourage in-depth discussion  
3. Invited speakers to present other viewpoints and complementary work  
4. A moderated round table discussion to develop future directions

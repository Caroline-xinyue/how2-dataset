hi (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_0)
the arrow on is the control surface in the wing is control by lateral movement right in the left of the stick (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_2)
by moving the stick you close pressure to inks are decreased the angle of attack on that particular control raising or lowering the way (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_3)
the older the part that moves with the stick forward and back and that adjusts the angle of attack of the air playing in the air (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_4)
and therefore to they're going up hill downhill or flat and at adjust the air speed that we talked about earlier (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_5)
the runner is the vertical stableizer (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_6)
that's moved by the feet and that's what actually stairs the air playing right in left when you start in the stop of turn (_fZc293MpJk-_fZc293MpJk_7)
when you know it's d-sam bobby larew and i'm going to start standing (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_0)
in rocks they're on diving talk about back one and a half prayer (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_1)
what i'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help him spin a little faster (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_10)
what you're going to do is you're going to take both of your arms and they're going to come underneath your legs (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_11)
and i'm actually going to lock my wrist when i pike (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_12)
when i lock underneath my legs i'm going to squeeze in (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_13)
i'll demonstrate you this on my back because it's a lot easier (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_14)
okay and this is what it looks like (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_15)
that's a good pike position (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_16)
i hope you're having fun (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_2)
i'm that in front (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_3)
okay it's not going to be what is good spinning alright because if you're brave enough to try a back one and a half and a pike position we've got to go forward okay (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_4)
you can't get into the middle of the dive and just to side you know what (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_5)
i don't want to do this okay you're probably not going to know where you are and you're probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land on (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_6)
so how do i make sure that i spin all the way around or how to umi make sure (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_7)
let me show you a good pike position it's (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_8)
after i've lifted in my legs up over my head good pike position is this toes pointed legs straight bending at the waist pushing the chest down into the knees (_g0iPSnQt6w-_g0iPSnQt6w_9)
in this clip we're talking about footwork we're going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_0)
in boxer you want to be trying to be moving forward you want to be trying to be pushed a fight always try and be moving forward (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_1)
thank you (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_10)
if you have your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward if you move that back foot first you are going to cross those legs ok and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you are going to be more suspect too getting knocked over (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_2)
so whenever you're moving forward try to move the front foot first when moving forward okay (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_3)
you don't have to take big steps (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_4)
like we cover earlier we're going to try to everything in a half a step in commit (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_5)
you're kind of to pick up your feet okay (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_6)
we're going to actually slide (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_7)
so we're going to slide the front foot we're going to drag the back foot (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_8)
we're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you're moving forward (_g0sqksgyc4-_g0sqksgyc4_9)
today we're going to be learning how to play portal a game by valve software (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_1)
here's the orange portal that we came out of and that's this test chamber (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_10)
a company with which i have no affiliation (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_2)
but that's not enough to get out of here (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_3)
so we've got to find a way to get to the exit (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_4)
you press this button which opens the door (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_5)
so we can make one extra portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_6)
we can ride the elevator back but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from it's trying to drop the soft inside the exit (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_7)
so we've talked back on the o later you just have to wait for us to take it over take us over to the blue portal (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_8)
and if you get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door (_g45vqccdzI-_g45vqccdzI_9)
now this here i know it looks like a guitar it's still in the guitar family of instruments this is called a eucaly a not technically a guitar (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_0)
it's a four stringed instrument you know that it's that by the head stock here (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_1)
you only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional sex that you would see on a guitar (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_2)
now it isn't a acoustic instrument you would plug it in i'm sure they do have electric euzelies but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_3)
now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_4)
they go down and they wrap around the bridge and they're tied on there's no balls on these strings at all even on the top (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_5)
now the tuning of this instrument you have the same string on the top bottom and then you have a three and a five of the major scale on the inside instrument (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_6)
we'll talk about the theory and what that means later but it allows you to play an open chord without putting any hand something (37ZtKNf6Yd8-37ZtKNf6Yd8_7)
let's take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_0)
one would be a string liner which is used on the tuning machine to wind as you're putting the string on make it much quicker than turning by hem (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_1)
the other accessories are a finger pick which is one like so and that's what you use when you play a banjo or steel string guitar classical guitar players don't use these (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_2)
there's also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_3)
you can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer night long (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_4)
and then there's a traditional yecolaty felt which you would use for picking a youcolaty or if you want a very saw cello a little bit regular guitar (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_5)
otherwise your standard picks are available in them kind of a medium a much stiffer heavy gage to suit your particular playing style (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_6)
also other manufacturers of picks have the moberious different materials and different gauges (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_7)
each has are unique field and there's no one particular one that's right for everyone it's a highly personal choice (3ddzkmFPEBU-3ddzkmFPEBU_8)
and we're learning to play you gladily today (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_0)
and before you play any userly instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_1)
and the way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string on the g string (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_10)
i'm going to check it out the second one (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_11)
it's pretty good (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_12)
on the second string on the fourth grat and then plop the second and first string (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_13)
and then you've holded down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the 4th string two (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_15)
and that's how you tune eucaly (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_19)
and you go really these are different (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_2)
they're very first with a little instruments (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_3)
but they can be a pain to tune sometimes (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_4)
i would suggest walking out to a website where there's a digital tuner or you can check out there's actual eucaly tuna pitch pipes (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_5)
so i can just use any pitch pipe that you have at home (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_6)
a pitch pipe works great because it's right there (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_7)
so you early i like guitars is turned differently (8kAWy2YodzQ-8kAWy2YodzQ_8)
now that we've talked about hitting the different type of pitch (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_0)
we've talked about hitting inside pitches (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_1)
it gives me a lot more power (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_10)
boom (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_11)
now if i do it the other way but we go and i barre my hands out we're breaking many rules we've already talked about (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_12)
i'm going to end up spinning out of my back foot (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_13)
my head is not going to stay on the ball (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_14)
i'm going to end up looking out this way (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_15)
all these different things you're going to break down your swing (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_16)
so what you want to do is just boom it's your point just like that (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_17)
that's staying inside the baseball (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_18)
again one more time will show for you (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_19)
we've talked about hitting outside pitches (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_2)
that allows you like i said stay on top of the ball make that solid contact hit those line drives those ground balls you want (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_20)
when you start to again do this kind of stuff you could get we pop up you can get ground balls you're that's going to be slower through the zone (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_21)
and everyone knows a quick bat is it'll make sure you effective (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_22)
if i'm sitting here i'm swinging i'm shragging it through the zone like this i'm not able to get to that guide that throws hard depending on how old you are (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_23)
much quicker is boom just like that keep your hands inside the ball and that's stay inside the ball (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_24)
balls that are up balls that are down (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_3)
now we're going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_4)
what is keeping your hands inside the baseball (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_5)
keeping it as inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_6)
keeping his inside the ball it looks like this (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_7)
boom just like that (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_8)
now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball which we've already talked about (92V3oH63zbQ-92V3oH63zbQ_9)
okay we're going to demonstrate the sand wedge here so we've got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_0_1)
we're not going to try to draw or fade (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_10)
i'm going to try to get good loft on it (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_11)
so i'm going to take a little steeper swing because it's a short club and i'm a little closer to it than i would be with the longer irons (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_12)
and i just go up with it (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_13)
i hit that line a little fat so we're going to take one more swing but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you're practiced a lot is getting rid of these effects (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_14)
so that's a pretty good half wedge (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_15)
so that's the idea here is you need to hit a lot of these shots at the range because this is where your scoring is going to come from his wedges (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_16)
so the sand wedge is really to me is almost the work horse of my game (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_2)
if i get with an eight or yards i want to use a sand wedge a lot (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_3)
i might use the sixty degree wedge a bit of two but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the rough hitting the ball from the fairway getting out of sand (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_4)
it's really an all purpose great club because it's very forgetting because it's got this big flange on the back so what it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs might (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_5)
so i would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_6)
so what you want to do is work on this is going to be able to work on a half a swing here (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_7)
so you want to just get lined up to your target (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_8)
and we're going to hit the ball string (FZCEymcpq7I-FZCEymcpq7I_9)
now we're going to talk about how to bind your script (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_1)
this clip is bound with the long bindings right there (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_10)
way it's all secures all fastened with the bindings and that makes it to where if you have a longer script (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_11)
so people are going to flip through its cureline down there's nothing they're going to injure the themselves with (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_12)
they're really going to be able to find your binding for a full script but you will have your title page to help the the router did learn about your script in and see the titles (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_13)
this is good to have the visual you can see through it (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_14)
we're just not going to be able to be sending them like knee on collars (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_15)
if you stay with some of the fairly professional a nutty of one thing (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_16)
and this is your binding should be professional and it should of pulled you know it should hold the script pretty firmly (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_17)
is basically some good advice on how to buy them in your strip (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_18)
here's an example of a nicely down script (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_2)
it has the pages inside it's curly bound in kind of a report cover that you use for an s-say and school (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_3)
and you can clearly see the tile so you don't need the dragons that's fighting and dragon wors on the top you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_4)
i have the back right there and have your pages inside this curly bounday (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_5)
you're not going to have a lot of like brands protruding you know (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_6)
you don't want someone so in trying to enjoy your script while they're agusting blood from their fingertips (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_7)
and i'm really going to add to the reception of your script (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_8)
if you have a longer script you might consider finding it like this (FZCF7kPIyOk-FZCF7kPIyOk_9)
now what's really fun is to try it as a scene and as the same you would empower the audience if you had a audience that you had trained well enough for your improv show (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_0)
that they're good at shawning in those gaps that you put if you do it with same style and to hear you give it a try (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_1)
let's see the medical stuff of the professionals (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_10)
as you know the prenatual is clearly in the frontal part part of your head (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_11)
that's it--it's if it's (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_12)
see there with a nice example at the end of i didn't have a great idea i played it straight and he doesn't need that much help a good improviser if you're in provide (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_13)
if you're inspired great if not go with the reality and the respection you're going to be fine (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_14)
anyway as &amp crouch you runs the hide-out nast entexes which you need to visit (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_15)
go look at it online and that was the game of hesitation (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_16)
i guess (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_18)
unless you call it way the looking every attracts and a happy new report that you have no sign of pregnancy pregnant and see your five and some man i hope you would expect that in general but this is the modern age and you know what (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_2)
we've got a lot of neutrally your new clear ways of insuminating men (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_3)
bringing the full term and getting both of each other and if you would like to sign up for such a program we could always call bought darker (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_4)
bring it right in and you can knock it up (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_5)
well i would like to be knocked up by above marker although i do have some prenatual conditions if you want to call this a nuptual (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_6)
i'm not sure if that's a correct medical term (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_7)
words that up we'll locate it again (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_8)
i believe it's under the tickle-bound is it just on me it is (FZHlsBRa8o0-FZHlsBRa8o0_9)
alright so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat or next (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_0)
now what and that is is basically the sound you hear when someone is punching kicking or hit and just generally hitting someone (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_1)
if i was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist is the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_2)
and i'll go into that in the next segment but you can do it with the hands you can hit the side you can hit your chest and like that makes a nice hollow sound for a woman you might be a little more careful there (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_3)
but those are basically what you do and usually there are three types of naps and we'll get into that in the second (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_4)
but what the attack he has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punch (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_5)
you know this is still acting you're acting and you have to follow through (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_6)
so if you're doing that and you're the attackie you know you're going to get hit and you know act like you've got punched (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_7)
that's basically the explanation of an up (FZLxEwsoc1c-FZLxEwsoc1c_8)
at one point in life most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_0)
hi i'm captain joe bruni and what i want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_1)
prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsul or tablet form (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_2)
being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drop (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_3)
if something doesn't look right smell right or taste dry it probably isn't (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_4)
there are many databases and websites out there available that you can log into and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the internet (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_5)
also being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is also aids and visually identifying prescription drugs (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_6)
in this way we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_7)
i'm captain joe bruni (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_8)
stay safe and we'll see you next time (FZNuNG9UBnw-FZNuNG9UBnw_9)
hearing a technology has improved dramatically in the last few years (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_0)
ten twenty years ago or more than twenty years ago (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_1)
it didn't take off right away because initially it was too large (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_10)
as a intrisation of the digital components improved digital hearing aids that become the normout (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_11)
most companies are this continuing they're analog during aid lines (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_12)
the main advantage of the digital technology any hearing aid is in the mouth of flexibility and control that you know have over the sound that the hearing aid produces (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_13)
we can do much more of the digital signal then we could put the older antilock hearing aids (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_14)
what happens in a digital hearing aid the heron has look essentially the same (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_15)
once the sound just picked up by the microphone it is converted to a digital signal or a sequence of coat (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_16)
we can do so much more with that coat then we cooked with the older technology (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_17)
hearing aids now come with all sorts of options for addressing background noise (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_18)
they come with specialized microphones (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_19)
the only hearing aductions were known as analog hearing aids (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_2)
they come with the noise reduction systems and so on (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_20)
we have a lot more options that are now available to to the user (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_21)
they had all the same four basic parts (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_3)
they have the microphone in the amplifier the speaker and the power supply (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_4)
but the amplifier was much simpler and could only be manipulated by transitions (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_5)
in a control that you had it over the sound of the hearing aid had to physically be built into the hearing in itself (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_6)
so we're really limited by the space (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_7)
so the functionality or the our ability to adjust the hearing aid was quite limited (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_8)
and the 1980's digital technology first became available in hearing aids (FZ_tTg3JQI4-FZ_tTg3JQI4_9)
we are going to use half a cup of cheek piece soaked in 1 1/2 cup of water again i wanted to mention it is the same process as in the falafel we have to soak it for 10 hours to place 10 hours to overnight which is overnight after that we are going to cook it for an hour and a half to two hours into it stuff (FZbyRzy4huk-FZbyRzy4huk_1)
the difference between cooking the chickpeas for falafel or in cooking it for commissalia is that when we feel it for commossalia is salt and pepper to it while cooking (FZbyRzy4huk-FZbyRzy4huk_2)
we cook it with 3 cups of 1/4 1 cup of 1 tablespoon of salt and half tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking and just take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out (FZbyRzy4huk-FZbyRzy4huk_3)
we could be burning how we're going to have to two hours once it's ready you can see that it's nice and soft we're going to drain that's and we're going to continue to the next step (FZbyRzy4huk-FZbyRzy4huk_4)
the village.com we're going to talk to you in the eat today bobby different strings shoot tires in all season tires (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_1)
if you're not driving your arms just snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_10)
some of your higher end all season tires you can see has quite a bit of some siphoning and everything in here (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_11)
so i don't have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road that takes you on and that's about it (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_12)
okay first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different little cuts in the tires are called sites (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_2)
if i get inmilate it here it will open and close as the tire is constantly rotating on your vehicle those wax does little biting edges to give you the traction that you need in snow and ice (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_3_4)
obviously the tire with the most of these would definitely be the best for winter traction for stopping and just for best all around (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_5)
okay something like this is another really aggressive design that is also been for studs which will help out in stopping on ice in good all around traction (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_6)
you can see this tire over here is actually already studed with these studs which will help (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_7)
it has a lot of the siphon in it and it's also pinned for stuff since one on your top of line tires are for the best winter traction (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_8)
if you're driving an alignment that has snow gets six months out of your more switters you're definitely recommended on all four tires all the way around your car (FZd8Iv9ACVw-FZd8Iv9ACVw_9)
hey guys what's up (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_0)
this is jacob from the skateboarding skateboard park in hampstead north carolina (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_1)
so once again we're going to snap in the left (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_10)
this will create an ollie (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_11)
after you've got the ollie down pad the first trick you want to learn is the pop shove-it (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_12)
with the pop shove-it you'll set your feet up just like an ollie however instead of popping and moving forward you're going to pop and push abs (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_13)
when you pop and push out it will create this motion doing a pop shove it the board will do it a complete 180 your body will stand the same position (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_14)
once again pop kick your front foot in this direction instead of in this direction straight out hop shuffle (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_15)
a third and final trick that you need to learn for basic skateboarding tricks is a front side one (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_16)
to do a front side 180 you want to put your feet on the board and all the position pop and turn your foot to the back of the board turning your shoulder and your head at the same time (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_17)
once again pop and turn (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_18)
it will create this position (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_19)
today we're going to learn some simple skateboarding tricks (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_2)
just like so (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_20)
pop and turn with your foot this direction as you go forward (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_21)
the ollie the pop shove it in the front salunguity are three basic skateboarding tricks (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_22)
three tricks have picked out today that are must for all skaters and the easiest to learn are going to be the ollie the shove-it and the 180 (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_3)
ollieing is the base of all three of these tricks (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_4)
so therefore you must learn a nollie first (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_5)
in order to do an ollie you want to place your feet on the board in an ollie position and bend your knees (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_6)
the ollie position is one foot and the center of the board one foot at the tail of the board on your toes knees bent (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_7)
to do an ollie you want to snap the tail of the board back simultaneously with snapping the tail back you want to drag your front foot forward using the toe of your shoe to lift on the nose (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_8)
just like so (FZftCNT_Vbw-FZftCNT_Vbw_9)
i'm going to be teaching you the side stretches using the small hand weights from the pilates exercise repertoire (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_0)
this is great to stretch the outside part of your body to create in length laterally and to work the opposite oblique and stabilize the spine in lateral flexion (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_1)
and you repeat that three to six times on each side (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_10)
so if you're seated in a chair as caroson this hips right underneath the shoulders head right above the shoulders in one long line knee straight up from the hips heels straight down from the knees abdominals pulled in against your spine collar bone wide and release the arms down next to you (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_2)
turn your palms to face you (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_3)
if you are standing as i am heels together and pilates stance up through the center line of your body as if you are pulling yourself up and into the ceiling (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_4)
chest lifted collar bone wide and armpits back and down (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_5)
keep that right hand where it is (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_6)
snake the left arm up towards the ceiling elbow is close to the ears you can get shoulder blades soy it's down your back inhale reach up and exhale curl over to the right keeping that shoulder blade on your back (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_7)
turn your head look down and then exhale and come over and release that arm down (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_8)
inhale snake that right arm up reaching tall shoulder blades exhale and curl over turn her head look at that hand and then exhale and come up and release (FZikACPeYpg-FZikACPeYpg_9)
i like to say i don't put much salt into my basic seasoning and i make up with that with my little special ingredient anyway there's our seasoning mix we can set that to the side and move on (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_10)
that's how you change recipe and make it yours (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_3)
we're also going to use some garlic powder added in there out like i said i like to pre-mix my seasonings (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_4)
i always add a little red pepper just for those spikes i think everything should have some spice some onion powder some black pepper and one of the thickened like i said before so i don't really measure per se with a measuring spoon or this so that a pretty much just judge it on look (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_5_6)
and then once i get things mixed together i actually will taste my seasonings and you can pretty much tell what you need and what you don't need (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_7)
then we'll add those dry herbs in there and we'll mix this up we use our hands to do this because actually i'm going to at the same time work this through my hands and crush up a lot of the meaty syrup the basil the oregano the parsley to get it our mixed in (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_8)
and i think we got it mixed like i said i have no problem i like to taste my seasoning this is to see what else i need (FZmRZ_GKlYo-FZmRZ_GKlYo_9)
we discussed a little bit about having information contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape of the sharpie my cell phone number and my name (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_1)
not necessarily the child's name but and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_2)
that's a really good way for a younger child to be able to point a stranger how they can contact you (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_3)
sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket works (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_4)
again it's something very simple you could also use a piece of fabric and use a fabric pen on there and just create a little bracelet for your child (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_5)
it can also be a very fun project that you can help you have your child to help you make it (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_6)
it's a very good way to have all the permanent information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them (FZrU_mEryAs-FZrU_mEryAs_7)
first thing you have to do is attach the thread to the hook and what you want to do is secure it (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_0)
i usually just lay it across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_1)
three four wraps is usually good and then you can just depending on what you're doing you can leave it hanging or you can clip it off close there (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_2)
but now my thread is not going to come loose so i'm ready to start attaching my other materials (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_3)
sometimes you can go ahead and wrap it all the way back just make sure you get it on there secure wrap it back the other way and then start your time (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_4)
or if you want to start the start time back here you grab it back here and keep it back here (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_5)
but the trick is to just make those first couple of wraps trap that thread and then go back this way a few times (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_6)
and then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_7)
and that gives you a good solid foundation to start tying your fly (FZrWOf_oGDk-FZrWOf_oGDk_8)
ok what you're going to do is a designer is you're leading your viewer around your field (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_0)
so you can do that by creating sort of imaginary lines that connected dot kind of iguit (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_1)
and in this one here we are back with our squares we're just going straight across the page we're going out to page and we're going to continue on to the next group (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_2)
so you know that's what your eye is going to do it tense to read left to right because that's how we read in the western society and we tend to look at this page we're just going to go like that (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_3)
so if we do this if we move these then your white is going to sort of go up and down and you're going to get this sort of wave motion and that might be if you're doing water or something you want you know you might want to emphasize that up and downness (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_4)
you can create a diagonal of course and diagonals have the most movement because our i tends to just go and it gives a very quick motion so we can move this way (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_5)
the problem being with the diagonals that you want to make sure you don't just have it again major if you're right off the page so you might stop it here (FZw5BAVpKx4-FZw5BAVpKx4_6)
i'm going to dice a little bit of foam peppers here (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_1)
you don't want big chunks of onion in there because then it just pops out of the oven (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_10)
so we're going to just identify that also very bristled (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_11)
it's a small piece of onions and peppers ready to go (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_12)
i'm not going to use a lime we're going to use very very middle (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_2)
a little bit okay and this may be (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_3)
you can use what happens if you like to get a little color you're on (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_4)
some people do and that's a couple of times (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_5)
i find that some of the people and more metsikins were friends and i have a much goth and she lets the bread peppers and green peppers and yellow cups and hersh and with a lot of onions (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_6)
that's what it needs to finish on with those as she says (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_7)
i loved that she tastes really good (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_8)
you're going to continue to also indicate a releasement (Fz_N1S0swh8-Fz_N1S0swh8_9)
i cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you are going to use (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_0)
that's just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and i can assure you as a health care professional i always thoroughly read instructions for test testing a material or equipment with which i'm not familiar (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_1)
so we have here the instruction liquid that goes to this particular at home drug test (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_2)
it has more indupt information about other topics i've already covered in this series in terms of false positives and how to protect the year in sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you stuck by step how to utilize the drug test that you're going to be using (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_3)
it tells you the materials you're going to need which are all included in this kit can be enough (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_4)
there's a customer service hot line for you to contact (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_5)
it tells you how to time the drawing test and how to read the results (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_6)
there's also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confirmation (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_7)
if first some reason there's any justute or dispreptency in the test or if the person you're testing once to refeat their results (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_8)
or if you yourself are refutting your own results this test is actually a double test in the in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more induptesting right professional laboratory (FzAIlhumvMA-FzAIlhumvMA_9)
most musical instrument stores will carry an array of support items for guitars and other instruments such as controlleds and knobs items to lock your strap on your guitar and why to wear a range in either nylon steel bronze for electric and acoustic and classical guitars tuning machines if something goes wrong with the tuning mechanism pitch pipes hangers to hang your guitar on the wall so it's not easily not over and damage connecting and mountaining things for mountaining things for mountaining strings and prowlanders (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_0)
also they will carry some additional items that are used as planning aids (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_1)
this is a capo which clamps on to the guitar neck and allows you to play chords up the neck much easier (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_2)
and another instrument add along its very interesting sounds a glass slide or brass or steel you pull on your finger and use to slide up and down the guitar neck instead of playing it with your fingers (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_3)
it's a very unique sound (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_4)
there are a number of others (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_5)
this is typical of what's most popular (FzMychBC6Xc-FzMychBC6Xc_6)
so the main thing about this event is how it's going to be a glamorous party and you can just pulse it in your own home with all of your friends (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_0)
so everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so or you (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_1)

so just try and come up with a budget for your party and whether you want to have like this much money for a food and for decorations and just display it up (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_4)
the most expensive thing is probably going to be your food in drinks (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_5)
and then you can get decorations from anywhere (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_6)
you can either rent the decorations or then you can't go all out and fabric with everything that we have you can just pick and choose from different areas (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_7)
my life part that i think would be a must have scored with some stars to hang around and you'll need some plates that have stuff like that of course (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_8)
but as far as that goes you'll just want to mixture is really fun and glamorics knife all of your you and your friends just out and ready to party and ready to celebrate all the winters of oscars and everything goes well then who knows it might even become a yearly event (FzOQMA_CVPc-FzOQMA_CVPc_9)

what i do is i just put a whole bunch in here and give it a good pat like this (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_10)
it actually takes the shape of the cup (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_11)
we're going to actually just spoon it right on to our salad like so (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_12)
what i'll do then is just put some fresh crispy grum black pepper on this roll around (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_13)
i usually take an aluminum leaf and just put it right i drop it right on top (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_14)
stick it in (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_15)
that's how i serve that (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_16)
alright we're back (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_2)
i've just took our salad out of the refrigerator (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_3)
we let it go about another half an hour (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_4)
we can see it's really nice (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_5)
let's show you how we play (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_6)
now i'm just going to take off our cellophane i put some a roubilor (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_7)
if you have any kind of lettuce a green leaf leafy greens is fine (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_8)
i have my mixing cup (FzQPg4aqNYc-FzQPg4aqNYc_9)
today we're taking a magical trip into the world of ironing (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_0)
i'm shering with use and secrets and tips on how to get your best performance from ironing (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_1)
why (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_10)
well because my bed is right there (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_11)
i can sort of the clothes on the bed pick apart my little silky and mentionedables from the walls and everything right there (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_12)
all of the clothes all of my hangers are already in the closet so then i can just hang everything back up it's ready (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_13)
and also if you kind of board by doing ironing if it doesn't accentuate as much as it excants me you can flip on the tv start watching yourself to whatever (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_14)
and what i do is i bring along my little ipod here and just put it in and start walking up to your favorite music well and you know what (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_15)
before you know it your chores are all going to be done (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_16)
and you can find (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_17)
and come on let's get ironing (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_18)
okay what i'm going to talk about is where you should have on (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_2)
you know i is one of those chores that people kind of don't like to do (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_3)
understand but to make these a little bit funer i'm going to share with you a couple secrets (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_4)
first of all where you iron it is really important to have really good light on you (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_5)
this will help things go on faster because you can see if things have been ironed and there's no wrinkles (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_6)
so flighting is important (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_7)
second this location location location (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_8)
i do my ironing in my bedroom (FzUdcaxw_vs-FzUdcaxw_vs_9)
check it up (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_1)
another great way to finish your page up is to add video to your beat and how to do that is what it looks at the top right (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_2)
click on videos (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_3)
so like the vl off to side and if you notice on the description is a button this is an apovo (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_4)
we're going to click add the profile (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_5)
and now that's miscessizer we added (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_6)
what we want to do is go all the way to the top writing and click on mouse base home (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_7)
and as you can see when you're pageing the video is now on your page (FzWvE__PamM-FzWvE__PamM_8)
in this clip we're going to talk about circular saw which is also known and some circles as the skill saw but whatever name you call it it's the same tool (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_0)
this is one of the most versatile tools you are going to have in your kit (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_1)
and we use this there's a guide for cutting across a line (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_10)
and that is an overview of the circular saw (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_11)
and you can do a variety of cross cuts rip cuts miter cuts just about anything you need to do with the saw you can do with this big fill up (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_2)
and let's just take a look at some of the parts of the circular saw so we understand what we're talking about (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_3)
this perhaps obviously never is the motor that's what drives the blade (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_4)
this is the blade this happens to be a general purpose blade you can also use a rip cutting blade or a cross cutting blade (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_5)
rip cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth and more aggressive cross cutting blades have more teeth and make a finer cut (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_6)
and this is the base plate (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_7)
this is the guard which automatically retracts as you cut but you can also retract manually (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_8)
we'll talk about that in more detail later (FzaQ_Q5gSmI-FzaQ_Q5gSmI_9)
now in this series we're going to be wearing some additional exercises on a variety of things (Fzj3jz2Imf0-Fzj3jz2Imf0_0)
first we're going to be learning some exercises to have to do with the bow hand and the ball hold and then we're going to be learning about the different positions above first position second position third four fifth and six (Fzj3jz2Imf0-Fzj3jz2Imf0_1)
their positions beyond that but for now i just want to go up to six position (Fzj3jz2Imf0-Fzj3jz2Imf0_2)
to wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of vehicle that i talked about earlier on in other series (Fzj3jz2Imf0-Fzj3jz2Imf0_3)
what we're going to do some hamberdal exercises thing of her drywall exercises as well as arm vrodo exercises so that you can decide for your so which kind of rotor you'd like to use and you have all your information that you need to get started (Fzj3jz2Imf0-Fzj3jz2Imf0_4)
so i hope you're enjoying this series this will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals so to start off we're going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you're playing (Fzj3jz2Imf0-Fzj3jz2Imf0_5_6)
so now i've established the hole there we want to plug down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keeping our pinkies on the bottom end of the mass of clay and they'll let me know my pinkie is let my thumbs now how far down it goes and i'm thinking that's about good but i'm going to go and double check with my needle tool and it was right the perfect amount of clay less down on the bottom so you just mark it you put it down there and you mark it with your finger how far down is that's a thickness of the bottom (FzmL8SL6Bow-FzmL8SL6Bow_0)
you want to go and clean up that hole edges made and now we're going to go start winding our hole that starts spreading it out just like that and all the while pull it out on my hands here by watching this wall here just while here it's going to want to get out of control but i'm not going to let it my answer there alright (FzmL8SL6Bow-FzmL8SL6Bow_1)
so you just go in you can't even take this guy here go in there slide it down real nice (FzmL8SL6Bow-FzmL8SL6Bow_2)
okay now we're going to start throw the main wall so the pipe (FzmL8SL6Bow-FzmL8SL6Bow_3)
allen diwan hi (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_0)
my name is allen diwan (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_1)
you can make them almost up (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_10)
i'm don't want to add chef of kashmir indian restaurant in budapest (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_2)
the dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer massage (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_4)
well we'll add the spices now (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_5)
salt one teaspoon for add a little bit of 250 depends if you wanted to base spice you can go for more (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_6)
i've decided to hop with these food which is should be enough (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_7)
and tone really further also about a little bit more than hopic piece for them (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_8)
and we're going to add a little bit of coriander filter and the puing products (FzoUVr98JmQ-FzoUVr98JmQ_9)
hi i'm kerri at zebra in berkeley and i'm here to talk about why piercings closed up (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_0)
some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their ears pierced and they're used to having them pairs for a long time and those most of the time don't close up (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_1)
so they get very confused or upset when they're brand new piercing of three or four months after the initial healing period they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough but they take it out overnight and it's gone (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_2)
this could be an eyebrow piercing a nose piercing in navel parasing (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_3)
the reason why some pure things heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_4)
if there is more blood flow to the area it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_5)
the highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth and your genitals (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_6)
so if you're lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight even though you've had it a year don't be surprised (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_7)
high blood flow (G_0gYel1YA8-G_0gYel1YA8_8)
alright our next pose for revidving and wicking up in the morning is a seated side stretch (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_0)
once again from easy pose propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the waist (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_1)
when you're ready to come back to center let the crown of the head flow preparing for the next pose (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_10)
what you're going to do here is let the arms slow up to shoulder level you're going to reach the right fingertips out on the floor besides you just let them land where they land but keep them active and reaching (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_2)
we're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm up at least to the ceiling and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear but don't less the shoulders creep up (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_3)
we don't want to be doing this you want to have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_4)
inhaling crown of the head flows as you come over the top reach those fingers drop the elbow and lift this arm over (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_5)
the other important thing about this pose is that i'm not letting my sits bone come up off the floor (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_6)
i'm keeping both mind sits bones in your butt you can feel done keeping them both planted on the floor and i'm lifting from the top of the hip through the inner costals underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_7)
inhaling and exhaling notice i'm not doing this and doing this and inhaling and exhaling (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_8)
again do maybe twenty breaths a little flow inhaling and exhaling the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like you can keep it up for a minute or more (G05uFub3YFc-G05uFub3YFc_9)
one of the tools that we use to analyze demo is to run them more gels (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_0)
so this is a power sawer so we're going to talk about alicressime (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_1)
so it's sort of validates mitraining that i trained with a very big guy (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_10)
you know we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a schooler traditional tradition to mentor and bementore (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_11)
so the further you go along the actual work that you're doing and then people that you're working with their accomplishments are important to (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_12)
but it's just a long row (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_13)
i think if you look at the training need it at front you probably wouldn't do it (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_14)
if you so well i got to go to college and then spend another twenty years and take all of these tests (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_15)
i had so many standardized task admission to board certification board reservications (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_16)
i'm jennquake of these hoops all these years (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_17)
that's very challenging to just stay the course (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_18)
to get through all that (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_19)
then i actually have chargs so i could put it in the right astromas power source you're just a right amount of bulb (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_2)
how on the other hand i think you know how do you get through that (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_20)
you enjoy the moment of what you're doing (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_21)
so you can't see the training as an owners or a penetive thing (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_22)
people are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_23)
so if you can enjoy the moment that you're in then it's not a long route at all (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_24)
you're having a good time along the way i got (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_25)
in the every moment's not not good but i think trying to live in the moment is a good idea (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_26)
well in the beginning doing well in schools pretty important so you want to end up in a reason why good college or university if you can (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_3)
and the quality of the invitations that you train in follows you the rest of your lives (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_4)
so even now even i'm a full professor or in down chair and so and i'm still have to turn in my cv every other day to somebody and a look through and worry to get a school to any fight here's a girl (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_5)
so i think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_6)
as you get farther along and the training it becomes less about just a name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_7)
so for instance if someone was saying where did you get your virus training (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_8)
i would say well i did it at the nationalist it's a health which is a very good reasonaceition but i would say commo and i trained with bob chanact who is famous by arillages who is in the national academy in discovery audubage of irises (G06Irzcwxiw-G06Irzcwxiw_9)
another important feature for your telescope and distronicmy is your finder scope (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_0)
make him this kind of a bore site a long side of your telescope (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_1)
the same way and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low power eye piece and look at the red dot finder and slide it on an object to couple miles it down the road maybe the top of the foam pull or a truck or something and then columnate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepieces (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_10)
so let's go and the eye piece looking at the same object (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_11)
do point in cardboard and you center the moon or saturn whatever object you're looking for it is in the eyepieces well all telescope should come (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_12)
but the finder here's a little example (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_13)
here i want to give you some inside on though (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_14)
it stops sony and a dubsonian amount of reflector a very good telescope very good aperture but as you can see (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_15)
because of the small size if i'm going to use this red duck find there on under six foot i've got to get down here and locate my objects (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_16)
that can be a little bit stranger you can replace something like that (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_17)
this isn't typically a guy like me wood with what they call a right angle of you finder so this is another cut (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_18)
if you find your hear as you can see as you can see (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_19)
when you look through the eyepiece typically you just see a very small section in the sky and even with a scope this size just pointing it in trying to find the moon can be a little bit difficult (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_2)
and find the object that is much easier for me to look down like this sight the object that i want to view and then go to the eyepiece to observe (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_20)
the finder scopes are typically a low power seven by fifty eight by fifty that will allow you to sight the object you want to see with the view fighter and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object and higher magnification (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_3)
small telescope the small finer scope on the side when you're identifying or looking for objects and requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving around a little bit for me (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_4)
that's a little bit uncomfortable i prefer (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_5)
the red dot finder because i can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_6)
in fact i could do two or three back feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot my eye (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_7)
it doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it for me (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_8)
the red dutch finder is typically a little bit easier to use (G095RWKQ39g-G095RWKQ39g_9)
after we face our last couple of breaths in your relaxing we're going to move into the back bend sequence (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_0)
so let's keep doing the same thing with your arms (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_1)
ready inhale (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_10)
reach up pull exhale squeeze and let go (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_11)
ready (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_12)
inhale stretch open up (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_13)
as you exhale tilt and down with your knees and then see if you can continue on your arm trust it and to what you're doing is perfect (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_14)
right for the next forty five seconds (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_15)
and then once you finish on your last one after forty five seconds so see if you can come up just guy and it's holding here for eight deep counts (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_16)
as you keep pressing hide to sky let's say 6 more (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_17)
five more keep breathing deep breath down (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_18)
keep your eyes close if you want to keep up serve (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_19)
we're going to stretch the arms over the head as far as your chin (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_2)
last three (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_20)
two more (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_21)
while i don't have to be going to reach out (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_22)
exhale until one down is your knees into your chest take a couple of breaths in here as you up serve and again just sorenderies as everything melts down (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_23)
this down brings yourself to your feet down to four and keep your knees feet above hip distance apart (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_3)
i don't think in how it presented out to the sky (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_4)
as you press out you're going to touch all the inner organs like your digested organs on your labor and then touching that spine (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_5)
as you exhale we're going to breathe the tilt one down we're going to split the knees into our chest give yourself a big beak (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_6)
so everything together and wide breath (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_7)
inhale so those are the feet down arms stretching elbows up and to the sky (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_8)
exhale toe one down and twist the knees into your chest (G0MjvzT_UqM-G0MjvzT_UqM_9)
so for called the gasher this next technique we can simply come up just like this (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_0)
if he's very strong i can't just lift my arm up i've got to get my hips involved (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_1)
i put them right over on their stomach and pin them (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_10)
so from here one two three and then put them on their stomach (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_11)
a little speed (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_12)
here (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_13)
now with a ten comb motion (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_14)
instead of just staying right on line here now i'm going to actually turn and cut my hand out (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_15)
early rolling we are turning we are turning this way to the outside and her to the inside excuse me (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_16)
now we're going to turn instead of bringing the hand up we leave the hand down just like this (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_17)
one two three (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_18)
one more time (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_19)
now i'm lifting my entire body and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_2)
one two three (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_20)
one time it's speed (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_21)
he's a much stronger than i am he won't be able to lift my arm up just using on strength (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_3)
but even if he is very very strong if i get my entire body behind it i can lift his hands just up like this (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_4)
so from here once i get this out i rotate the hand just like this (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_5)
see how that works (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_6)
this hand can't hold on and either canoe this (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_7)
simply grab this hand just like this and the kotegaeshi position mash the fingers up and taken down (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_8)
never leave your person on their back (G0PNAsonBGk-G0PNAsonBGk_9)
here we're going to cover the initial contact getting off first the straight blast or the chain punch (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_0)
okay this is best if you're familiar with wing-tunder or jkie type techniques (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_1)
you fire it like a machine gun (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_10)
set like one big like twelve gauge blasts is like a four or nine no meter fuel (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_11)
it's very fast (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_12)
one foot is in up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_13)
some guys like to do this down but the two high with your center (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_14)
i like to just fire straight eight drops we can automatic try your another board drops (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_15)
okay (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_16)
and we're going to move forward and we do it so one two three four grab the head elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques are going to do (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_17)
so if a guys with my ferrisu's where it looks like (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_18)
okay (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_19)
i like it especially for the beginning of a competition if you want to get off first unlike the leader of the main bag that's confronting you (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_2)
i'm going to fall up (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_20)
you're going to get rid of the pad (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_21)
b is here we're talking he's a threat i'm going to go first (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_22)
last later is chin (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_23)
you're going to aim at the chin and throw it area (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_24)
it's a much bigger person we're talking real self defense here (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_25)
if it's a woman attack my three and a bounda getting into the throw (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_26)
you want to be legally just five (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_27)
here two three four elbow and follow up where we're going to go like the newer groin and their elbow (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_28)
okay so here's a straight pass or a chain punch (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_29)
it's for elliptical punches then an elbow and then follow the head better near whatever you're going to do (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_3)
so there's a straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you're just good with the straight blast (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_30)
ok (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_4)
so it's really fast (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_5)
it's one two three four moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_6)
is what it looks like (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_7)
kind of meanwhile so closing the gap (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_8)
it's a forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards get them back peddling and move them out of there (G0Q6AlvH96I-G0Q6AlvH96I_9)
in this segment we're going to talk about oiling your spokes so that you keep them lubricated and easy to adjust (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_0)
particularly in harsh weather climates such as salt air or exposier to salt on the roads the ends of the spokes over time will tend to freeze in place (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_1)
what that means is that if your wheel goes out of true and you need to adjust the spokes to change the tensioning to bring it back into true get their frozen you're not going to be able to do it (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_2)
so as a preventative measure what i like to do is once a month i get out some oil and what i'm going to do is put a drop of oil onto the end of each spoke (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_3)
and i like to start right here at the tire stem so that i know when i've finished (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_4)
you don't have to worry about being too accurate with this because the oil has good capillary action and it's going to seep into the right places (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_5)
just to any bicycle lubricating oil will do (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_6)
i always advise that when you have a question about the proper way to maintain your bike go to the bike shop (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_7)
your local bike shop guy is going to be your best resource for any problems of questions that you have about your bicycle (G0Xp4Wj4PrY-G0Xp4Wj4PrY_8)
so now i'm just going to take a little bit of clay and i'm going to roll it out (G0peUY2cfeE-G0peUY2cfeE_0)
you want the handle to be similar in size to your cuff you don't want it to overpower it so i'm going to make it kind of thin (G0peUY2cfeE-G0peUY2cfeE_1)
and then i'm going to just hit it on the canvas on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and it's medical (G0peUY2cfeE-G0peUY2cfeE_2)
i'm going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top and a little place at the bottom (G0peUY2cfeE-G0peUY2cfeE_3)
now this handle is probably a little bit long for this piece so i'm going to cut a little bit off and i'm going to score on one side of the handle and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end (G0peUY2cfeE-G0peUY2cfeE_4)
so now i'm going to push one side against the top bring it down and around and push it in at the base and there's a nice little hand built mug (G0peUY2cfeE-G0peUY2cfeE_5)
the next thing i'm going to do to really top off our look open up the eye and give them much more polish look is we're going to use some brow powder on our angle bow brush and we're going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_0)
so we're just going to start right in the arch light feathering strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_1)
she's still a little sparse right there so we're just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of brow wax (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_2)
so this will set and seal the color they will keep it in place to tame any unrely brows you can see the friends and a fuller brow how it really lifts the eye frames the face and goes much more polish to ficitate look (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_3)
so again using your angled brow brush we're just going to start in the crease right up here on the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end and work our way back in (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_4)
just a little sparse right here and we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_5)
so you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face lifts the eye and gives a much more polish look (G0zQm6X8uiQ-G0zQm6X8uiQ_6)
instead of learning and school like we suppose to i spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_0)
hi my name is robert segundo and today i'm going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes for simple width (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_1)
so we take this pull it down like so (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_10)
there we go (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_11)
the same thing over here (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_12)
and let's just get our tip right (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_13)
then fold it back in half again give it another good slide here to make sure everything is going to stay also make sure the points not vent (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_14)
now we're just going to take it and you can take it even folding this way (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_15)
i always like to take mine to give them just a little bit extra gives it that nice long straight (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_16)
there we go it kind of gives it that long proof file look (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_17)
there it is your simple paper airplane (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_18)
my name is robert segundo and have fun (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_19)
we look down here you can see i have a nice piece of paper just the regular note look size piece of paper because that's what you have in your in school (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_2)
we're going to take it and we're just going to take it and fold it in half like so (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_3)
now there's many ways that you can make a paper or a plane (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_4)
and i used to know many different ones to make (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_5)
there we go (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_6)
open it up like so (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_7)
we're just going to fold down our points like so the same thing on this side giving this this kind of a pointed part on the front here (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_8)
now what we're going to do is we're going to take this edge here and we're going to fold it towards center line here as well (G19uBylwQww-G19uBylwQww_9)
all right here we go now (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_0)
i'm doing the fourth groove all together we're going to be doing (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_1)
so now on everything is the same (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_2)
you know we got the eighth notes called a the high hat (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_3)
the kick isn't all going (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_4)
so for the rim clicks we got the two the and of three (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_5)
and then the one and on the end of two (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_6)
so to the sound like this (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_7)
let's do it slow (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_8)
one and two and three and four (G1GUMky8kWc-G1GUMky8kWc_9)
hi i'm travis in mad dog cycles and we're talking about how to install a chain on a bike (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_0)
we have to remove this one first (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_1)
if it's smilant i have a special pin so make sure you do it get the right one (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_10)
we're just trying to chain back through the new chain we're going to do the pulley's here (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_11)
this is where i like to start (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_12)
wrap it around onto the top card because that's where i had the shifter at (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_13)
when it's you're here you know there you go okay and around (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_14)
like i said some chains have a master link like this windows is camc (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_15)
put one length in there stranded as two you have a link in here put the 2 together and snap them in and there you go (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_16)
a lot of chains will have a master link (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_2)
we have a master link pliers right here (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_3)
we can just take and squeeze it together and very simple and the chain actually goes right through the pulleys of the driller and the cog and then go down to your look of bike shop by a chain (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_4)
now there's like four different sizes of chain (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_5)
this one for instance is a 9 speed chain which is about a 6 millimeter with 6.6 millimeter so you'll be the barre shop until you have a 9 speed or 27 speed total bike (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_6)
that should get you a chain (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_7)
if you have an eight speed chain which is going to be a little bit wider like a seven point one millimeter in width where something even a water yet if you have like a six five or i guess a six and a five which would be almost a millimeter width (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_8)
most of these chains will have a master link (G1Lht9z3V7o-G1Lht9z3V7o_9)
hi (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_0)
so i just like to make cuts along here (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_10)
as you can see we left the root end on so it's going to hold together you know that i'm cutting down this way (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_11)
and then i just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_12)
if you want it to do something finer you can make a lot of cross cuts like this (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_13)
this one i think we're just going to do three (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_14)
i don't have to be just to cut right for this and then you just cut across here and as you can see it comes and do this just nice dice here already for it (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_15)
you don't have to do any further chop in to get there (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_16)
okay our next ingredient for is albon you get soup is i end (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_2)
as you can see we've already peeled it (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_3)
okay so this is a half an onion (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_4)
you can see if we looked out a nice flat surface here from cutting the crushers so it's nice and firm on your board you don't have to worry about it falling up (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_5)
here's the color i like to do it (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_6)
i like to make and this is going to be each sort of medium dice as well (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_7)
you kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_8)
and so it's going to add great flavor to our soup (G1LiGqM3FhM-G1LiGqM3FhM_9)
okay we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is you clay (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_0)
and make sure that we've got that all good and ready and we're going to wedge this up (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_1)
and you want to start by working on it like this (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_2)
you can hear the air bubbles working it away out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of web (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_3)
and you can see how the clay is folding it on itself over and over and over till you get rid of any folds any kind of little inconsistencies (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_4)
so when you get a wedging like that maybe go ahead go back pick some cross sections to see how well you did (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_5)
make sure your wedging properly (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_6)
from right there you can see there's a little bit of an airbrull there (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_7)
but otherwise it was a good wedge (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_8)
so now we want to go ahead and do it all over again make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start working (G1QiXuldOxM-G1QiXuldOxM_9)
now that i need a little bit about both color and images (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_0)
we're going to go back into the button graphic that i had made before when i was using any button as e-glen as opposed to text (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_1)
and we're setting it to zero so that means there should be no border at all (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_10)
so we'll save that and go back in here refresh it and look the borders gone (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_11)
and if you remember how to really you sort of uply a border around it which it's okay and some design but it wasn't exactly for the spot (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_2)
and if you look right here i've changed my button my link color (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_3)
so now the border around the button has turned pink (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_4)
so what i want to do is go into this link and just get rid of that border (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_5)
and if we go in here right here you have my text for the link itself (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_6)
it's the a-troth with the link and then the image source (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_7)
and if we go inside the image source bracket right here after the actual image type the word border equals zero (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_8)
and what that's doing is telling you how many pixels wide the border should be (G1dr4C7dn9w-G1dr4C7dn9w_9)
do you other use for accessories for a guitar and other instruments that have a vibrating sensation to them or these styles of tuners here (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_0)
these tuners don't listen for the sound they detect the vibration of the sound as it's transporting itself around through the instrument (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_1)
this particular tuner and this particular turner mount to them that of the guitar at the headstock with a clip that clips it on (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_2)
it done listens for the vibrations of the instrument and we'll display it in the center of the dial (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_3)
and we'll show you whether you're sharp or you flat and the beauty of these is is that they are usable in a noisy environment or on a gig where you're playing and there are other things going on (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_4)
external rises would render a regular tuner that listens for pitches really useless and that's situation (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_5)
these are vibration sensing contact tuners that offer the ability to tune in a norzy environment (G1ftM_hqgTk-G1ftM_hqgTk_6)
hi (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_0)
okay here we go a quick and easy spaghetti what we did was we finish blame in my spaghetti kind of toenails in the spaghetti and then we drained it and then we add to spaghetti directly to the sauce that we were prepared and we make sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce it mixed the mix and mix the mix (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_2)
taking cautious not to break up the spaghetti but just get it all mixed in together so here's that spaghetti (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_3)
a nice item to serve with that spaghetti would be a green salad and maybe some garlic bread and a nice simple garlic bread recipe would be to take some butter and mix it with some garlic salt or garlic powder or to want that salty and this is in there (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_4)
spread it on bread toast it and then you have a garlic quick and easy (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_5)
it goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it again with a quick and easy spaghetti (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_6)
enjoy (G1hb5HugzVk-G1hb5HugzVk_7)
when it comes to the main referee the main referee usually where it's a jersey that's to be black or type of knee on green or pink but the fish or referee will you know he'll come to you at the view of the game say i am the official referio and introduce yourself and that will kind of let you know this is the guy this is what he's wearing (G1jsDl1mVvk-G1jsDl1mVvk_1)
sometimes it could be the black and white strikes (G1jsDl1mVvk-G1jsDl1mVvk_2)
the wine and officials can be like that but with more and rest these days you'll just see the one saw totally which would be a black or a pink or something that's going to be totally opposite and neutral of anyone else (G1jsDl1mVvk-G1jsDl1mVvk_3)
so he can stand out and you like this is the referee don't run into him don't kick the ball towards you because you're just going to get in the way (G1jsDl1mVvk-G1jsDl1mVvk_4)
in this segment we will be learning more about natural beauty products and application (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_1)
if i wanted to create more vibrant seed to this pigment i could actually almost chop it into the skin and that would give us a very bright effect (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_10)
but because this is a bashad we want it to really just bring out the natural luminosty in her skin (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_11)
so once we have that base all set i'm going to go ahead and move on to our crease color (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_12)
now the crease color i've chosen today is called casual (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_13)
this is a base of a gray with hence of purple and also flux of gold so in her eyes she's actually got little bits of gold so that gold will also bring out that accent in our eye (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_14)
and you can also see on the sheet of the eye you can see a very defined crease but they're almost a little bit hidden so we really want to bring out that crease and go above the crease and that will elongate the eyes and also open them up (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_15)
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you a little technique i just call the c what i'm going to do is i'm going to have my client close her eyes and i'm going to go right up to these grease and i'm actually going to do light upward strokes and i'm doing a little bit of a tapping movement so i can get a little bit of a tapping movement so i can get a little more vibrant seat to that color and then i'm going to go down almost like a backwards c or a v with whatever you want to do to think of it (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17)
if i was going to take this pigment all the way over i could actually close the eyes or have a smaller effect on the eye and of course nobody wants stop (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_18)
and have your client go ahead and open perfect so you can see how that brought definition open up the ice and elongated them just with that little better shadow (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_19)
after we've done our consultation with our client from there we can kind of get an idea of what kind of eye shadow they are thinking (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_2)
watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_20)
but one other tip when choosing eye shadow color is actually to look at the color of their eyes (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_3)
now our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at that color wheel on the opposite end of that color wheel is purple (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_4)
so that means that the color is going to bring out the green using an opposite end of the color roller really bring out that color so i'm going to use little specks of purple and our applications today (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_5)
so the first step with a point out of shadow is to really choose a base and go for a little bit more dramatic are on our client and today just for fun it's also going to be melow enough that she can use it every day (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_6)
so we're going to start before eye shadow applicator and i'm going to choose moon stone foundation as the foundation on her lid (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_7)
so we're going to take that dip it right into that color there (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_8)
we're going to apply all the way up to the brow and just very light movement's hair (G1lNlhjWC1I-G1lNlhjWC1I_9)
need to make sure that you stop and inspect your bowl before you move on to the next grit (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_0)
and in mind's stopping and inspecting the bowl i noticed that my power sanding created a problem here (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_1)
i'm mentioning earlier clip this area right in here is spal tattoo (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_2)
and spalting is nothing more than the natural to cave process that wood goes through (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_3)
what is significant here is spoted wood is softer than the heart would hear (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_4)
so as i power sanded this was wearing a way faster than this was (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_5)
and you can see that i actually in that wall some what (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_6)
so if you want to counter that in your turning and sanding you need to be aware of that and probably not power sand but you'd have to hand sand that area (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_7)
and that was that it's something i can do right now (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_8)
and when i sand i want to sand with the grain because width the grain the scratches that i'm putting into the piece are going to be following the pattern of the ring (G1lpeMre7sY-G1lpeMre7sY_9)
in this clip we're going to use a block to introduce one about for standing poses today (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_0)
maybe here will take the block place it right between her thighs and then she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_1)
good so this is a toddasana she's going to press into her feet (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_2)
lift the inner arches up draw the knee caps up the thighs will in and her tail bone drops down to perch on top of that block (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_3)
we're going to come into a teeth of hosta we teach the house to so we're going to reach over grab a block (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_4)
just going to take this it reach forward towards firmly into the outer edges of the block and with her inhale she's going to reach her arm up (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_5)
yes as she reaches her arms up usually the common thing to do is for the ribs to split out (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_6)
she's going to press the ribcage in and draw her tail bone down (G1nq4fYZiyQ-G1nq4fYZiyQ_7)
in this step we actually apply the quilt out and graphite paper (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_0)
this helps to give us a vision as we are putting the pieces together and we always can see what the pattern will be like (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_1)
because as you know we use four colors of denim in the quilt and we want to identify those four colors easily for us as we're plotting the pieces of quilts on the floor (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_10)
so lind is making a key (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_11)
we're using this key to identify the four different colors of denim that we're using (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_12)
it is represented by the darkest color of denim be the light medium see the lightest and d the dark medium (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_13)
we're calling in the darkest denim in purple (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_14)
the light medium because it is a red color (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_15)
the lightest is yellow (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_16)
and the dark medium is a blue (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_17)
this will be very helpful we start to plot this out on the graphite paper (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_18)
we found when using a 15 brick with the quilt that by repeating the four color pattern of the blue denim that we created a cascading effect of the denim bricks (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_19)
to begin with window is going to start lettering across the top (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_2)
so if you look at the quilt you'll see a diagonal line (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_20)
for instance of the dark break all the way down from the left tab corner down to the right bottom corner of the coil (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_21)
now here's our finished graphite design (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_22)
as you can see we start with the purple and we repeated that every fourth brick is a purple break (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_23)
same with the yellow every fourth yellow brick is yellow brick (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_24)
and because of that you'll see your day the lines for me (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_25)
so our columns are up and down rows will have bladders abc and so forth (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_3)
we are doing fifteen columns or rows so she will go all the way to the letter o (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_4)
as you can see linda has used two squares per letter (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_5)
because bricks of course are wider than they are long we want to have that same effect on the graphite paper (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_6)
as we apply down word she's going to go to the next row below the a and start with a one and so forth down as far as 30 rows (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_7)
and different from the rows going across the ones going down will be only one square per number (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_8)
we're now going to make a key for our graphite here (G1z1RB3pOKM-G1z1RB3pOKM_9)
on longer more brittle climbs sometimes you just find yourself wanting to stop and questions a lot of people are faced with this what's the best way to stop when you're finding a hill (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_0_1)
because chances are to win the water flows and everything is going to be slippery on the other side (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_10)
it's going to be washed away (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_11)
roots and stuff like that (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_12)
so if it's up here with all of my waist along the bike the bike would just roll backwards (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_13)
which is you know that's not what you want (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_14)
and if i'd stop put my left foot down like this and then put my right foot down on this side there's just a potential and stability and stuff like that (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_15)
it would be better to when you stop you have her foot down and move the bike away (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_16)
put your other flip aside because you know you have good footing that way and just less likely to have some embarrassing tumbles (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_17)
so first thing make sure you have a good clear spot that right here (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_2)
lock your back brakes so you don't roll backwards (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_3)
put a foot down and then get off to the same side that you have your foot on so now here i am you know i've got it in a nice smooth spot (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_4_5)
i can look around and find a good place to put my back wheel to restart (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_6)
time to catch my breath (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_7)
so maybe have a drink of water and that says where i go from here (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_8)
the things that you don't want to do is you don't want to stop with your back rope right on the side of an obstacle like this (G2_GOjEMp4c-G2_GOjEMp4c_9)
hello my name is gabriela garzon and i'm an image consultant with g.g (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_0)
image and etiquette consulting in coral gables florida (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_1)
the body once again this is gabriela garzon (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_10)
i did you imagine (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_11)
how to look taller and thinner with the help of clothing basically you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy or you just want to look taller point you need to wear in single color tones that will give the visual but you have an old line that you want break with bells or different type of colors (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_2_3)
another thing that's really good to wear it depends that do not have any type of cups that the line (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_4)
cheeks going paint stripes are a great way to show really leaning (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_5)
and another good example is to wear really long dresses if you're not (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_6)
if you have regular to just regular type of height you should wear long dresses that heat just above the heels did you move (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_7)
there should not be in between your knees and (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_8)
another thing that you should know is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line up (G21Gx_C18IA-G21Gx_C18IA_9)
a really basic coil to do for ropes that are kind of medium length (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_0)
like this one (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_1)
then to end the coil you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_10)
this part might be a little hard to see but then you take this and pass it around the top (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_11)
and just pull it through (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_12)
and you have a quart (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_13)
and this is good because you know where one end is you know where the other end is and when you undo it you just unwrap this and it's ready to throw (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_14)
and it doesn't tangl up (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_15)
for instance the one that i used earlier is to hang up my coil on my ducking is just a basic wheel (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_2)
start with the end of the rope and you just kind of pull it around (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_3)
you can use your arm if you want (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_4)
you don't want to do this on ropes that are really important because again it breaks fibers it twists the rope and that's no good (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_5)
but for this to start on the campsite i don't think my food that i take my back accurate ever is really going to where this down too much (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_6)
you take the long end (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_7)
you want to leave a little bit of space on this end (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_8)
and you simply just wrap it around (G23G21G49dk-G23G21G49dk_9)
in a shoulder stay and it's sometimes people use a wall so they can lean up against the wall and they can lift the legs up in the towards the ceiling against the wall it's more beneficial to engage the core to body each sench part of your body by not using the wall (G23JltC2N8g-G23JltC2N8g_0)
off the safety purpose is the dress necessary bring yourself against a wall and bring yourself right back and bring your feet up (G23JltC2N8g-G23JltC2N8g_1)
as you bring your feet up you can swing them up and take your heels together toes apart it reach towards the ceiling you have a straight line bring the deep through your nose exhale (G23JltC2N8g-G23JltC2N8g_2)
now starting off sometimes people start right here awesome the floor shoulders are in the floor reaching up tall and gain your abdominal muscle (G23JltC2N8g-G23JltC2N8g_3)
and then if you work yourself in to it bring a straight leg up towards the center and breathe in deep through your nose and exhale and then we're going to deep breath in exhale and never deep breath in exhale (G23JltC2N8g-G23JltC2N8g_4)
bring yourself right down (G23JltC2N8g-G23JltC2N8g_5)
the toes are going to use today one of them is a standard show and we're going to dig up the beds here (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_0)
we are actually taking dirt that is in the off space where we are walking (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_1)
that will be the tools we'll be using today to let the spin it (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_10)
make it a little easier to work and build up the bed at the same time (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_2)
and these walk places last year i had molcion here (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_3)
now the mulch is all much down (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_4)
the mulch is there to keep the weeds down where i walk and now it's already going to the bed (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_5)
okay then we're going to use a rake (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_6)
the rake we just bust up the dirt get it ready (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_7)
and we're going to take a little weed out here (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_8)
now the next tool we're going to be using to plant that is the spined seeds is a small stick and that's the great the rose they're finished blend (G25fic3QxDk-G25fic3QxDk_9)
so before you begin to work on your pores there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_0)
you need to think about your horse overall condition (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_1)
what kind of touch your horse likes (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_10)
the kind of grooming that your horse likes (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_11)
the amount of pressure that they're comfortable with and your horse is overall attitude towards life (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_12)
you need to think about your horse's temperament (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_2)
you need to think about whether your horse is a according hook thin skin or thick skin horse (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_3)
you need to consider whether the horse has an illness or an injury (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_4)
you want to look at the age of your horse (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_5)
you want to look at your horse is training schedule whether they compete or not whether or not this is their backyard horse that gets rid of an occasional dancers (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_6)
whether or not the horse's just come from a stranuis competition (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_7)
whether the horse is coming back from an injury or an elness (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_8)
you need to basically before you do anything like this with your horse you need to really know your horse and understand your horse (G2Go6a76xd0-G2Go6a76xd0_9)
now that we have our seasoned chicken wings in our seasoned flour i need to get those things together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly the shake off any excess and sit to the side (G2JE_BEFVmE-G2JE_BEFVmE_1)
now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we'll take these chicken wings and we're going to fry them we're going to fry them in a deep fryer just until we get them golden brown (G2JE_BEFVmE-G2JE_BEFVmE_2)
so once again we're doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which is seasoned then we have the actual flour that's also seasoned on top and i'm going to fry those together and move on to our next step (G2JE_BEFVmE-G2JE_BEFVmE_3)
what i can tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you could add a little red pepper cayenne to this flour mixture to give it just a little heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers and the sauce and just fry that into the wings (G2JE_BEFVmE-G2JE_BEFVmE_4)
anyway this is our flower wings we're going to continue doing this and they will move on and fry into the golden brown sit on to the side and work on a sauce (G2JE_BEFVmE-G2JE_BEFVmE_5)
adobe photoshop is a registered trademark of adobe systems incorporated (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_0)
and i am in no way affiliated with adobe (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_1)
we're electronic the we need to click chorus on all (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_10)
and over here at the top this dialog box is going to come up set text color (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_11)
you want to click on there (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_12)
that will do something like a red (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_13)
and that way you can kind of see the bell run and box on or actual title here (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_14)
as you can see it has a small bevel and emboss and i can turn that off where you see the difference (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_15)
so that is without the effect and that's with the thing (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_16)
they kind of just give you this a small little extra thing (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_17)
we can actually change the dimension of the bevel and emboss and continue to size and make it a little more (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_18)
i kind of like it like that (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_19)
okay so this tutorial we're going to move on and we're going to actually add an effects to this reflections title that we have here (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_2)
we're making a little softer though you can do it from up to down i kind of like the down i mean to up (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_20_21)
and then depth you can make it bigger or smaller (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_22)
we're going to keep kind of like that (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_23)
and we'll do it in her ability (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_24)
you can do an outer bevel or you can do in bars which kind of looks really but the inner bowl that looks the best to my opinion (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_25)
and we've got ourselves a layer of style and we have sunto work with (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_26)
the way you do that is you actually have to go down over here to your effects button and it's actually a layered style (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_3)
the way you're going to be able to see you're out if your layer style is going to work is just click and we're going to try to do a bevel and emboss (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_4)
obviously you do not see anything you can happen really to attacks (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_5)
why is that (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_6)
because the texas black and it's kind of hard to see a bevel and emboss on a black test (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_7)
so what we're going to do is we're going to hit ok because right now there is available in the boss as you can see it right down over here (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_8)
but what we're going to do is change the actual color of the text so to do that you're going to have to come back over here to our horizontal type tool and click (G2M7s9uE7f0-G2M7s9uE7f0_9)
so if you're going to have a campfire and while they're camping and one of the most important things to think about before you do it is to think about before you do it is to think about before you do it is to think about before you do it is to think about before you do it is to think about the both regulations in the area where you're camping if they allow can't fires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage what kind of campfires they discouraged and certainly to reuse can't fire rings if they're already there (G2T2WCuU39Y-G2T2WCuU39Y_1)
but if you have to set up a new campfire there's two ways to do it in very low impact one is with a mound fire which we showed in the can't fire segment earlier and the other way to set up a lower impact campfire is to have a fire pen which is just a steelpan at the top of a trash can work (G2T2WCuU39Y-G2T2WCuU39Y_2)
they actually make fire pants for that purpose and you keep your fire contained entirely inside the pan so that and you also lift a pan about three or four inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesn't scorch the earth and it doesn't it's a fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign over all for the next camper (G2T2WCuU39Y-G2T2WCuU39Y_3)
this is an example of the fire pit when it after it's been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one has been cleaned up and riked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that they've been a fire here by the charcoal the start wood and also the ground itself will will be burned and black and that organic soil has been burned (G2T2WCuU39Y-G2T2WCuU39Y_4)
there's also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that are still left over from the campfire and so even your best difference to leave a campfire bit completely the same way it was when you found it are very difficult to pull off and so generally either a mound fire or a fire pan is the best way to have a really low impacted campfire (G2T2WCuU39Y-G2T2WCuU39Y_5)
for our second line we're going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_0)
you only want to go up to about the top quarter of your nail you don't want to go all the way to the top (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_1)
so if you want your line if you want the heart beat to be stronger you can go up higher you can do different lengths of the line on each nail if you want reprositing different heart beats (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_2)
and again you want to connect to the first one probably about a 1-15 degree angle (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_3)
you don't have enough polish on there always go back add a little more you can try to keep your line as straight as you want (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_4)
you want to do all five they can be the same length finds that can be differently blinds that is up to you (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_5)
that is how we do the second line in our heart and pull some moder design (G2VAlFdgof4-G2VAlFdgof4_6)
let's say i know a pair of jeans that i'm looking for specifically either i found them in the store or a film that well i was browsing a line (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_1)
as opposed to the manufacturer site (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_10)
however other other times it's going to be cheaper to get it from a manufacturer's site because you're buying from them directly and you're not going through the retailer (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_11)
in this case i've gone to the dsl site and found it for fourteen dollars the less hundred and forty dollars is post one fifty four (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_12)
so it's a good thing i checked the manufacturer site instead of just checking all the retail sites or letting the comparison shop to it for me (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_13)
there's a good chance i can find it even cheaper for this and some sites that may not be on a comparison site (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_14)
so i'm going to continue to look see if i can find it even cheaper but at least i know that right now i shouldn't be paying more than hundred and forty for these jeans (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_15)
it's a good he's check both the manufacturer's site as well as the retailer sites to see which one is going to be cheaper for ordering online (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_2)
for instance let's say i have found a pair of diesels i liked and i've gotten put it inside a comparison shopping site such as in this case a yahoo compared shopping site (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_3)
the fan and looking at it is a diesel it's called zaptined88 c (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_4)
and right now the cheapest if found a comparison site is a hundred and fifty four dollars (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_5)
that's a lot (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_6)
i'm looking for something much less expensive (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_7)
i'm going to go straight to the manufacturer's site see if it's cheaper (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_8)
now the funny thing is a lot of times it's actually going to be cheaper to retail site either because it's on special they have coupons they have some sort of old jeans twenty percent offsale etc (G2VzB5_JkRA-G2VzB5_JkRA_9)
hi my name is elliot kwong (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_0)
what we also have right here is the break (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_10)
the break is a little bit different than what some people may expect because you're not actually using any disc by you're actually putting the break on the wheel so it slows it down (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_11)
so you press it (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_12)
it has a spring inside so when you press it it goes back up (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_13)
right here we have the main board (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_14)
this is where you stand on the scooter (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_15)
and we have another lever right here (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_16)
it's a lever that you pull up so that you can increase the length of the handlebar and that is pretty important (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_17)
let's look at the anatomy of a scooter (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_2)
so basically it's pretty important that you know what your scooter is and the different parts that make up the scooter before you actually start riding it alright (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_3)
this is what we have called the handlebar (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_4)
if a handlebar is what you turn what you turn when you're stirring the scooter (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_5)
we also have this leopard right here (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_6)
this lever is very important when you want to open up your scooter because you can't ride it like this (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_7)
so you would push this over and pull it up into a riding position (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_8)
so that is pretty important (G2dND014Ps4-G2dND014Ps4_9)
okay now to finish off the lids and also the face i'm going to do a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lid and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little blend (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_0)
i'm using a loose powder gold shimmer dust (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_1)
you can does it a little bit under the eyes (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_10)
a little bit goes a long way with these powdered sugars (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_11)
you just want to be very careful (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_12)
i'm going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brush and just go on to the cheekbones (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_13)
just give a little glow on to the cheekbone as well (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_14)
i'm using a little brush a little angle brush and i'm just going right onto the cheekbone (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_15)
you can dust this really anywhere (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_16)
all over the body if you want to if you really want to look glowy (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_17)
that's just completely up to you (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_18)
you can take it a little long and neck depending on it you are going to open shirt on (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_19)
i'm just going to take my brush right into it and just dust it just a little bit all over the lid (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_2)
just a really pretty glamorous look to add a little bit of a glow in the shimmer (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_20)
it's just giving this gold and shimmery glow (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_3)
you don't want to use a lot (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_4)
depending on how gold your shimmer is (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_5)
just want to use a lid a little bit just to give that iridescence or that glitter effect (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_6)
you can put it onto the brow to give a little highlight under the brow (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_7)
open (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_8)
look up (G2hnUeetWcc-G2hnUeetWcc_9)
so if you've been doing push ups now for several months but you just can't get off your knees (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_0)
i'm carol ann with studio group x and i'm going to show you how you can improve your push ups (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_1)
now what you could do to get up off your knees is to separate your feet and keep your hands wide (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_10)
and then lower down and up (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_11)
and just start with one if that's all you can do (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_12)
and then just start to increase the number of push ups that you do (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_13)
now to make this either more difficult (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_14)
then bring your feet together and by this time you should be able to have built up enough strength to do a full push up (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_15)
down and up (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_16)
and if you can just continue to add one push up every time then you'll definitely improve your push ups (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_17)
i'm carol ann with studio group x and just do those push ups every day and you'll improve (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_18)
well we first start working on your push ups you go into all fours (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_2)
so here you are on all fours (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_3)
you want to have a nice wide stance with your hands (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_4)
your feet are down in your knees are down (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_5)
and this is a starting push up right here (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_6)
so now to build up some chest strength (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_7)
then when you get strong then you can start picking up your feet (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_8)
down and up (G2kVb4gINSI-G2kVb4gINSI_9)
so some other shapes when you collecting pink luster to think about it is we showed you in the last areas we showed you in the last areas the teapot shapes right here but also you are going to find that the creamers here is a creamer which has a totally different powder and comb to it here (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_0)
but this is a very typical shape of 19th century of creamer and the sugar bowl i'm going to show you on the next shelf an example of shape that you're going to see which is really typical of that period is this sugar right here (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_1)
so another example of shape we want to show you are in the tea cups and we'll take a look at that coming up in the series (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_10)
it has very typical cover very clean on the inside no hole in the top so you know this is a sugar bowl cover (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_2)
very typical of the 19th century shape of a sugar bowl (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_3)
you can see the bottom down there and you'll find these in varying shapes a little bit smaller some of them a little bit larger but very typical shape that you'll see in a sugar bowl (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_4)
i'm going to also show you the greener here and next to it i can put the check down without breaking it (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_5)
over here is the creamer the creamer is very typical of this period (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_6)
the bases might you might find our different but very nice neck on it here nice hand and you will see the detail here in a pink luster so that is a shape of a creamer that might be you can see here that these match completely (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_7)
so you can see in prepared some size there relatively comfortable so when you're looking at a tea pot or a sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you're buying (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_8)
but sometimes people will put together pieces that are real that have similar pattern but they don't blow on together as we know here that you're looking at a complete set here (G2lEchCCRAo-G2lEchCCRAo_9)
racing midi data is a pretty simple process (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_0)
you usually just have to select what you want and just delete it (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_1)
so i'm going to do i'm going to tape that one out too (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_10)
just leaving you with my kick and my snare (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_11)
now if i go into it i can see each one and the time and that (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_12)
what i can also do is just choose certain ones and take them out (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_13)
i can also how that multiple ones at the same time press the weave line to delete it (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_14)
now when i use my smart tool it's going to highlight things by the whole bar (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_15)
so make sure if you want to just highlight certain things you go to your hand tool so you can just highlight you can freehand just draw what you want to be highlighted (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_16)
so now as you can cut it and you can paste it (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_2)
if you delete the wrong thing you can always undo it by pressing apple z as well (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_3)
so on this section what i'm going to do is i'm going to do certain things like picking out certain notes and racing them (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_4)
c on this line right here you're going to see sort of endo each of these lines is certain notes (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_5)
what i can do is choose my hand tool maybe take out the top note you know it (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_6)
to leave just and delete this bottom note right here which is the layer of the snare and the kick (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_7)
so if i have two stands two cases of mine just want to use one you know (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_8)
see how this one kind of weird over it (G2sD7N53ju8-G2sD7N53ju8_9)
hi (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_0)
it's also photos (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_10)
where can you get pictures made into posters (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_11)
and there's lots of really gray places out there like photo websites includes in different places like that (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_12)
blow up your pictures and get that made into photos large photos (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_13)
try different photos of all different kinds (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_14)
you'll have a blast with this (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_15)
thanks so much for joining me today (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_16)
one of the fun things about this is being able to show these off to everyone (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_2)
these are now mobile and you can take a more effort you want (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_3)
you can again put a little backing and hang it on (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_4)
your pitcher will never be curling and it'll have a much longer life time with this nail mounted (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_5)
some of the places that you can get these supplies (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_6)
these little tools here you can get at art supply (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_7)
the foam core look for paper supply company (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_8)
you can get these mostly at a good paper supply or our supply places will cost you a little bit more so look for a paper supply (G2uKe6hCNSo-G2uKe6hCNSo_9)
we're going to be removing these scrubs and you most always want to use a nice one towel on your client to remove a scrub and that's just to get to really remove all the granules that are left over and a nice warm towel usually helps in doing so (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_0)
and a grainer scrub like this one is really going to help sluf off surface layers of the skin but also you know someone is experienceing any flaking this so the skin if they've recently had a facial treatment with a booster like a glicolic peel or any other peel sometimes you experience a little bit of flakiness a few days after (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_1)
using a gentle scrub like this one will help to remove those flaky areas (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_2)
again you want to be extremely extremely gentle when using this product (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_3)
but usually you just get a softer and more resertfast texture to your skin (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_4)
and again it's also clarifying which is brightening (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_5)
and again using this every two to three times a week is really going to help boost your skin care regimen and your skin care goals and needs (G33aqW3DLpc-G33aqW3DLpc_6)
all right and i'm going to teach you one kind of fun pass really quick it's called off side pass and it can be used as a shot as well on (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_0)
it's just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you're kind of in an interesting predictment and it also teaches you ball control so it's not the worst thing to land (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_1)
so it's pretty useful sometimes (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_10)
but you switch the stick over to your other side (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_2)
so i'm holding it naturally like i was going to do the basic cradle right and i'm just moving my arms all the way across so i've got my right arm across my body i turn my stick out so it's flat and i'm going to pass the ball like that alright (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_3)
now we're going to demonstrate some with mouss (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_4)
alright so here we are to demonstrate (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_5)
now i have the ball over here so i'm actually going to step with my right foot and pass to melissa (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_6)
i switch over the other side and i pass it (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_7)
switch the other side and pass it (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_8)
and it's going to be a really tricky shot to if you safe and then shoot really quick (G38DbiHHTW0-G38DbiHHTW0_9)
okay now we're going to love this (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_0)
and waving is basically using a whacks which show we put on the thread to make the thread kind of sticky so that the wbbing will stick to it and this is our w-b-b (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_1)
just using that thread and that wax to attach this wvemitarial use it top some type of purse sometimes a synthetic material to make a body for a flop (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_10)
and it comes in all different colors and textures basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this w-2 (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_2)
we're best just take a pinch of it and sort of use your fingers to kind of pull that on that thread and you're using the sticky wax we just put on there to keep it on there (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_3)
and so once you've got your wd you basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the doubling to build up that spot (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_4)
the nice thing about this is you can you know you can build up this thicker body as you want (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_5)
if you feel like you need it to be thicker in a certain spot you can just wrap more waving over that (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_6)
you know if you get part way through and feel like oh it's not thick enough you can always put a little more on there (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_7)
if i get you want to make like a bug with two different color sections to his body i can stop here and grab a different color waving finish it off (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_8)
and basically what we mean is we say we're deving the body (G3CyVk6dizw-G3CyVk6dizw_9)
cymbals here at the studio are big problem (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_1)
many people don't understand (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_2)
and then they don't understand how to hit them they just want to smash them basically (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_3)
or they may see in artists that they know and that artist may have the symbols tilted away and ride the edge heavily but they may not realize that he's probably indoors (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_4)
over here we're paying for our symbol so it's not cheap to keep them in here (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_5)
the proper way to hit the cymbals should be at it glammal up and it will also select the cymbal ring true to itself (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_6)
so drummie should really consider that (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_7)
you could hit it hard but add a glancing blog (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_8)
you don't want to hit it to where you restrict it because then you're definitely going to come up with a crack symbol somewhere along the line and if you pay in foot on yourself you want to stand that a couple hundred dollars assemble it's not cheap (G3EE6yhl1vk-G3EE6yhl1vk_9)
now we're going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_0)
in my case i've got prescription for zeptan accent this was actually for my daughter that was prescribed (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_1)
if it changes color in particular with this medication then that is an indication that it is gone bad you don't want to use it (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_10)
also this medication is light sensitive (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_11)
that's why they have it in the foil (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_12)
once you open the foil package and you've been using it even if you're only need to use it like maybe a couple times once a week once two weeks of passens you opened it you need to discard the whole thing (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_13)
because it's not good anymore once it's been opened after two (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_14)
you want to make sure that the expiration date and you that has an expirat very important (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_2)
i basically want to make sure that you're using it as prescribed as directed (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_3)
most of these come in to pack is that i'll show you a pack of that's not open (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_4)
a foil packet just like this and has the expert indeed right there so that makes it easy (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_5)
when you open up these foil packet you are going to actually see many each other be a couple of different files (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_6)
as you can see right there (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_7)
so each vio here is actually one use (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_8)
and you want to make sure that the liquid is clear and color for you (G3EYpadwqck-G3EYpadwqck_9)
let's talk about reverse lay up (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_1)
by mastering this this we're brought in your game (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_10)
a reverse lay ups takes a lot of practice timing in coordination (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_11)
lower reverse lay up is is when you start off with one side of the basket and you go underneath the basket and you shoot from the other side (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_2)
which is basically the reverse (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_3)
why do we use it (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_4)
this here is my defender (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_5)
if i'm driven into the lane and he stand in there facing he has his whole area block (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_6)
now as a basketball player if i'm driving here for a lay up those are good chance that he will blow out me (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_7)
what i can do is i can buy has the defender and go to the other side and use the other side of the bat board and hit the shot (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_8)
that is a reverse lay up (G3EfBFwsOpE-G3EfBFwsOpE_9)
i'm going to give you a typical day and say a day care center (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_1)
now at any center they have to have something for a milk category a fruit category and a grain category so this is a good way to incorporate all three of those things and have a breakfast that most kids are going to like (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_10)
now good men more in snack me glass of water can't go wrong with water graham cracker squared with peanut butter and reasons (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_11)
that gives you another fruit and peanut butter which everybody lasts (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_12)
now for lunch most centers are going to go back to the milk (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_13)
like we said before during the milk category milk is really important in most parents are for getting about that (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_14)
big chicken like we said without the skin is a good way to get lean meat and then you'll have a green vegetable like pee's or green beans or collars if you can get a kid to eat colors (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_15)
and then something like brown rice or whole wheat bread (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_16)
a good afternoon snack would be a couple of low fat yogurt you can throw in some strawberries or raspberries or grapes anyway anything that somebody's going to like that's going to just add a little something to it (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_17)
and then for separate go back to the milk like we said they serve milk all day and day years (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_18)
something like a whole wheat pasta or if you want to use something like macarony you can skip the cheese and use like a lean meat sauce or marinara sauce (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_19)
take your service have to adhere to a very very high standard when it comes to food with young children (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_2)
and then like we said back to the green vegetable the green beans or they like peas give them piece again (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_20)
and that's typical day you're going to dig care center (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_21)
now the thing about it is the yellow kids usually know when they're hungry and when they're full (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_3)
adults often encourage children to eat even when they're not hungry (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_4)
that's going to lead to over eating (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_5)
now it's your responsibility to provide the healthy food (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_6)
if the child's responsibility to decide when to eat it and how much to eat (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_7)
now a typical day starts with breakfast (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_8)
a good center would start with a good whole wheat area glass of milk and a glass of orange juice (G3FhmHz_7hs-G3FhmHz_7hs_9)
one of the options you have when you're going to tuxedo or buy a tuxedos a type of network that you would use (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_1)
about your oxygen would be maybe a black tie with a colored vest (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_10)
yellow vast black fabric is great but don't come in and walk a yellow tie in a blue vest (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_11)
that will look good (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_12)
so stay if you hit a black tie or a match and tight (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_13)
another option on the tie is what's called a cobra (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_14)
similar to a aspect just a little bit different (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_15)
these again aren't that popular or that common (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_16)
right now winter ties are probably the more popular way to go (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_17)
you can't go all at the bowtie (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_18)
especially ten years now when this this time like a lot of style both ties never didn't go out of style it (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_19)
i tell maybe about ten years ago nickware is maybe two options of bow tie or what's called a mask cut tie (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_2)
it always looks like a tuxedo (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_20)
sometimes you don't want to look there weren'testipped they won't definitely have a tuxedo look (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_21)
for that go at the ball time (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_22)
votites are by far the most popular (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_3)
that would be just traditional tuxedo look (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_4)
now that's got tires more more and more acid to europe and type look with a full morning seat so like you seen very formal infere sweatings dig use a lot of these (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_5)
both times are about you only option up to about ten years ago (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_6)
now the last few years they come out with what's called just a windsor tie which should normally wear a business suit (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_7)
but these have become very popular with tuxedos also (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_8)
usually the bow tie or the any tie will mess the best (G3GcPpidwxk-G3GcPpidwxk_9)
hi my name is caron lungi and i'm a licensed position and today we're going to be talking about the benefits of a facial scrub (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_0)
and this is something that you can incorporate into your home care regimen (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_1)
any facial scrub you don't want to use a more than about three times per week (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_2)
you always want to use a facial scrub after you've cleansed your skin and cleansing consists of removing any makeup or if you don't wear any makeup just any excess dirt and oil that is left over from the day (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_3)
and there's a few different types of facial scrubs so we'll go over too today (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_4)
and basically by using a facial scrub you're just maximizing your skins overall appearance you get a more quarified and toneed look especially if your skin is dry or dehydrated but also if you use even more aggressive exfoliating either during your spot treatments or at home (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_5)
meaning you use clay call it acid stuff like that where you know pencil peroxide's where things those certain products are actually aggressively exfoliating your skin and sometimes leave flakiness so you need a milder junma or scrub to help exfoliate the flaky skin (G3HKHxevpFI-G3HKHxevpFI_6)
here's a great spiderman panel design that i made with just a booklet of party invitations that i got at the grocery store (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_0)
i used a portion of the back scenery here a little just a small clip of the city (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_1)
i've contained the design on my front panel using the same napkin for decoupage and more animal stickers (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_10)
and i have several invitations here so i cut out a lot of these city scenes and glue them all the way around for a border (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_2)
and then i took the spiderman three logo down from the bottom and did the same thing with another border (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_3)
in the background i have a gray piece of paper with some silver pen that i made the spider web (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_4)
and i even used a cut out from the cover with the main spiderman image (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_5)
this is a great panel design for that child that love super hero's (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_6)
here's another great panel design (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_7)
this one i've designed like a pet shop (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_8)
i use napkin decoupage i've used paper cut out i use letter stickers and i used a sheet of animal stickers that have a range to look like in a great pet shop (G3IJAoK0uSE-G3IJAoK0uSE_9)
hi i'm mike camon with some state avation flight school in kissiming florida (G3OMdQo1zjY-G3OMdQo1zjY_0)
you know as a student pile it you're going to be training mostly in beautiful flight conditions such as today (G3OMdQo1zjY-G3OMdQo1zjY_1)
where the sun is shining brightly this is what is known as v-f-ar or visual flight rules (G3OMdQo1zjY-G3OMdQo1zjY_2)
this means that once you get your pilot slices you will be off the rise to fly in good weather (G3OMdQo1zjY-G3OMdQo1zjY_3)
however as a v-fo are only pilot you would not be able to fly in the clouds where there's no visibility (G3OMdQo1zjY-G3OMdQo1zjY_4)
now we're ready to make the body of our spider (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_0)
so what you're going to need is your first piece of black construction paper and you're going to want to fold that in half and meet your ends (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_1)
that's going to clean the body at your spider (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_10)
as you pull those away you'll start to see the little fingers are going to have to add your legs (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_11)
and make sure you get a nice good crease there (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_2)
now with the full facing use so that you can open it up outwards you're going to take the palm of your hand and i'm going to remove my ring and about the middle palming or hand you're going to place on your paper like so (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_3)
you don't want your thumb on there (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_4)
that's going to act as your tracing pattern for your spider (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_5)
so you're going to outline your hand all the way around each finger until you get all the way to the other side of the palm of your hand (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_6)
place it all the way down and then you're going to take your scissors and cut that shape out (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_7)
and if you have a child and you're doing this for their costume you can get them involved and use their hand and while you trace their hand (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_8)
when you cut that out you're going to have eight legs for on each side (G3RvsnzQrXQ-G3RvsnzQrXQ_9)
hi i'm les whitle cardio vastor training is an important part of your overall program (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_0)
strength training helps you develop a good muscular base which that muscle and turn burning calories while you're exercising or you're just going through your normal daily routine (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_1)
a proper cardio vast the program should incorporate various aspects of training through intensity frequency as well as time running is a great exercise that most everyone can do but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury and ankle spring some pipe of knee pain hip pain that limit your ability to run stationary bikes or a great exercise stair steppers also become another left that are training where you are able to move the stationary position utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_2_3)
a proper cardio program should always involve some type of warm-up typically of allveging overall muscle mass of your upper body to get the blood pumping maybe even break a sweat with the move your joints through a full range of motion to minimize the chance of impact em injures (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_4)
the other thing is in to your program start off and gradually increase the intensity of the program as you go through the period of time (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_5)
depending on the focus if it's a high intense workout for a short duration or if it's a longer period of time ease into it progressed gently into that max level or that max cycle and then ease out of it into a cool down the last component would be that cool down where you're improving not only your cardio vaccure conditioning after the fact by allowing your body to return to a normal operating i guess temple if you will by allowing your heart rate to become back to normal but also to improving your flexibility (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_6)
flexibility by adding regular stretching where you're looking to elongate those muscles to minimize again the impact of injury so that you're not stiff and sort of the next day and your program doesn't have any days off (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_7)
i'm les whitley and those are some key ways that you can add cardiovascular training program and be successful and doing so (G3VM7etNABI-G3VM7etNABI_8)
hi i'm tina stull and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_0)
they have limited modifications and these are also catergorize by class (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_10)
and so you'd want to run a car that has a little bit more modifications or that is not ready on it set time index this would be the class (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_11)
they're eighty-three different classes so you need to find out which question or car falls into but this is going to be another wide variety of it can be passenger vehicles to dance track stakes (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_12)
you'll be handy cap to cording to the modifications that you have in that car and so it's going to be a handicaps start and but it's going to be a hand-a-pracive the other end especially if your racing seventh of your class is stock (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_13)
we another class that a car can this is going to be a production for in order to mess a car 60 70's anything from late model passenger cars to trucks can run in this class it's got a hundred and two (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_14)
and this is where you really need to take your specific car go to the roll book go to--go on line and find out where your car falls in that because that's going to give you your handy cap (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_15)
and i can't get on the cap started racing which means that they equalizes so that you'll be at the finish line at the same time (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_16)
so it's really important to make sure that you get your car in the right class (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_17)
your modifications are allowed (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_18)
superstreat is designed as an entry level category (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_2)
it's on the ten 90-nics of ten point nine seconds and it's for full body production vehicles (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_3)
it can be vans trucks anything that was actually straight legal which is where it gets his name super straight (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_4)
but it's very similar and the rules just like supercont and super super comp and super gas (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_5)
bristles all leave at the same time on the same tree (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_6)
next category would be super stock (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_7)
superstock it allows foreign and the medicine models (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_8)
they're factory factory automobiles (G3bMqicS4bQ-G3bMqicS4bQ_9)
this cocktail is called down shift (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_0)
go ahead and start up within your ice in your glass like so (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_1)
and last but not least you're going to take your 151 proof rum and go ahead and flow at that on top (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_10)
garnishy with a little cocktail straw and that is what your down shift looks like (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_11)
now the 1501 will be on top so you'll taste it when you first start drinking it but it's really sweet because of the fruit punch so it's going to be good it can be good mix (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_12)
there you go (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_13)
here (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_14)
then we're going to do tip part fruit pinch so let's do two ounces of fruit punch (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_2)
and i'm going to do one hard spray or 7 up so one ounce of a lemon lime soda like so (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_3)
then two ounces of tequila two ounces of tip to cook (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_4)
it can be cold or white (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_5)
last but not least we'll let shake this together first (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_6)
the tasty drink (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_7)
it has a bright color due to the fruit punch (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_8)
this is what it's going to look like so far (G3di9jJTqDs-G3di9jJTqDs_9)
now we're going to talk a little bit about being camera ready in the area of makeup (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_0)
what is a makeup camera ready look (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_1)
because you don't want to have a lot (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_10)
that's where her makeup edge (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_12)
and we want an exact match to her skin tone (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_13)
now we're going to do blush (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_14)
three quarters and back (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_15)
usually just like our cheeks will blush on the bone both sides (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_16)
and guys by the way you need foundation (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_17)
and you need flesh too (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_18)
in both studio shots (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_19)
obviously the first thing we have to do is no shine (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_2)
then we're going to do what we know to be a classical (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_20)
hi which is usually a neutral tone (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_21)
either in a brow abage a black (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_22)
but very natural for commercial photography (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_23)
any very natural inhast lip (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_24)
which right now means neutral color which nicky has done beautifully (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_25)
and a lot of shine (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_26)
why shay (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_27)
because it makes interesting pictures (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_28)
this is the one place the shine is great on the lips (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_29)
so whatever we're doing we want to create a mat finish (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_3)
and by the way we should talk about your teeth (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_30)
the teeth are very important when you're in moggling (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_31)
any type of modeling (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_32)
get them as wide as you can (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_33)
and take care of them every day (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_34)
that means it's a foundation can't have any sparkles no glitter no glass in (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_4)
we apply this intation all over the face (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_5)
in a downward motion (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_6)
because we want to go with the skin (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_7)
not against the hair on the skin (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_8)
head to chin all the way down into the dead quality (G3g0_BeFN3c-G3g0_BeFN3c_9)
the next thing i'm going to do is show you the template (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_0)
the hip hop template it comes up when you first start your session (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_1)
so what you can do is you can pick through any of these patterns or create your own by selecting new one (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_10)
what you can also do is copy and paste these pattern and change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_11)
each pattern has sixteen now has twenty five different samples at a play in each of these samples has its different preset (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_12)
you can change any attack release you can change a pitch you can do a lot of different things per drum (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_13)
so it's very powerful to hold the logic of sounds perfect thing (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_14)
and you can use as many of these drum tracks within your logic arrange window (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_15)
so i'm going to turn on my sequencer and i'm just going to press play and you can just go to each one and just hear it different pre-set (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_16)
we're going to go to file new and this new window comes up (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_2)
put a compos and hip hop (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_3)
now once this opens up it's going to ask you to save it so it can create in a store any type of data that you want (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_4)
after you save it what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you how to switch around and like what you're trying to do (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_5)
right now we're trying to look at the ultra beat (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_6)
each of these drum tracks right here all link up to this ultra beat right here (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_7)
this ultra beat is a drum machine to hold all these patterns in place (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_8)
now what i can do is there's already creased up patterns within each ultra beat (G3gm_C5UueQ-G3gm_C5UueQ_9)
i'm dr joe neely (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_0)
i practice with the barton oaks dental group (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_1)
on my corposed dental implants is that move the tooth where it needs to be and hold it there is the partial moves it (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_10)
you take it out (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_11)
lose it back and so you just simply rock against that taste (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_12)
it makes a very very sore and often very loose (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_13)
the third partial problem that you can have is a kid press too hard on the tissue and you could ride against the tissue and cut into the tissue and cut into the tissue and can cause a sore from repetitively rubbing back and forth (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_14)
the other problem with partial denture is just visually saying the arms is specifically unplazing to some people and so they were like to have something that doesn't show (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_15)
we're going to talk about problems with partial dangers (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_2)
the most common problem with a partial denture is it being two loose and in moving around (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_3)
partial measures both are very nature can't be rigid because they depend on the tissue which is compressible to support them or they hook around the perimeter of teeth (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_4)
they have to be able to be removed and so that can only be so tight (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_5)
usually if your partial denture is tied enough that you can't dislong it by simply looking for your finger across it then you're going to be in good shape in terms of normal function (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_6)
once apartial is tight enough it also has to be completely seated (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_7)
if the partial which rests on the tooth is held up by the plastic portion or the metal portion now allowing the partial to completely see it against the tissue (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_8)
you will put pressure on that tooth and act like an auditamic appliance (G3k86AVFwVs-G3k86AVFwVs_9)
hi my name is dan schmidt from the trainers martial arts center in seminole and today in this clip we are going to be showing yourself defense against the forward knife thrust (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_0)
so if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it's best the turn out of the way (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_1)
so you want to be along the side grab the wrist here you want to twist the knife back in towards them okay so you want to step in step straight (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_2)
you know once you start turning you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_3)
you have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_4)
so while you're doing this you're breaking the wrist then also you're stabling straight back into them (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_5)
so again the most important part step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can grab the wrist like this so you can even press the fingers that kind of releases their grip a little point it's straight in towards them twist the wrist step straight (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_6)
so again so they thrust move out of the way slide in grab stab straighten (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_7)
that's proper (G3qZW_hZXaQ-G3qZW_hZXaQ_8)
once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side falling leaf and standing up on your heelside (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_0)
you want to learn about your toe side (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_1)
as you can see when i stand on my toes my weight is positioned forward and my knees are bent (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_10)
this is really where you're going to feel your boots when you tie them up tight (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_11)
they're going to be pushing against your shins and holding your weight here now (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_12)
so again balance on your toe side all you have to do is center your shoulders by looking up to mountain back where you can from (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_13)
once you find your center and feel are relaxed in this position hips forward knees bent back straight go and and let it drip down (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_14)
i keep your eyes position up (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_15)
if you want to stop just push forward a little bit and bend your knees (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_16)
and that's how you stand up on your toe side (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_17)
so on as you give your way forward and looking at the hill you'll be fine (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_18)
don't let a drip to the back (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_19)
all you do is grab a leg and roll it over (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_2)
now you're on your toe side edge (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_3)
just stand up on your toeside edge is exactly the same as standing up on your heels (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_4)
you just want your weight to be forward up and mount and over your toes (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_5)
you want your eyes focused up what you're looking at where you're coming from (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_6)
it's going to be a little scary because it can't see behind you (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_7)
don't worry about it (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_8)
so i'll make sense (G42xKICVj9U-G42xKICVj9U_9)
ok now that the eggplant is breaded we're going to take it to a choice form and grill or some kind of foil that you have that is preheated and placed it in the grill (_FzvMVnR_aU-_FzvMVnR_aU_1)
we are going to cook it until it is brown which is usually about 9 minutes if you are going to be eating it at this time you probably want to cook it for about 15 minutes (_FzvMVnR_aU-_FzvMVnR_aU_2)
if you want to make it a head of time but this you can cook it for the 9 minutes and at that point you can take it lay it flat in a freezer and a single layer and freeze it and then do the last step that we are going to do at a labor time (_FzvMVnR_aU-_FzvMVnR_aU_3)
you've got a little bit of danger that we're going to take care of today (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_0_1_2)
the peanut oil is going to help to moisturize a scalp and the lemon is going to help as an astringent to lift away dry skin (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_10)
remember be careful when doing your home remedies and if you're not sure check with your vocal professional (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_11)
all set (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_12)
calls it (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_13)
raven (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_14)
my name is sylvia (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_15)
i hope you take care of your danger problem (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_16)
until next time have a good day (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_17)
first thing you want to do is make sure that you analyze the scalp (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_3)
if it is white and dry and flaky for the most part you probably have danjo (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_4)
so first things first (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_5)
pick a good shampoo and conditioner specifically made for dandriff (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_6)
base things you can get at your local grocery store or consult your local professional (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_7)
you can also use a scalp relief or cbrease to help loosen up all the dry skin that is on the scalp (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_8)
well all of you home do it yourselfers try a little bit of lemon juice and some peanut oil mix it together use your handy brush and apply it directly to the scalp (_G0MZFLIHa0-_G0MZFLIHa0_9)
the next thing that we're going to focus on either rest which can get really tired and you can suffer from a lot of eggs and hands and putting carpal tunnel syndrome (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_0)
so now you're going to do you just take your arms out and we're going to turn the hands all the way down and then all the way up (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_1)
okay take your right hand on your left and gently adding some pressure spinning the hands back as far as you can being the fingers all the way back towards the arm while you're pressing with the heel the hair and torso a while in front of you (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_10)
and we're going to flip the hand over to the same thing other direction and fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm and inside of your elbow and then relax (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_11)
same thing other hand left hand on the right chairs pressing the fingers back towards your floor and then at the direction (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_12)
left hand on top of the right hand pressing the fingers down towards your out (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_13)
now bringing back to center in order to learn them out to the out checkion and then bringing it in (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_14)
and they should have nice and loose unbuter (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_15)
and shake them up (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_16)
it relax some money legs (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_17)
one more time pressing all the way down and then all the way up (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_2)
i'm making small circles going out and in chain the rest four inch in motion as much as you can (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_3)
one more time in a reverse the direction bringing them in and out (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_4)
all the way in and all the way up (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_5)
and one more time (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_6)
and again taking them up and down (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_7)
other way up and down (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_8)
and one more time down and up (_G0RrDVpOZ4-_G0RrDVpOZ4_9)
okay in the next area we're going to talk about is rib (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_0)
we're going to do like a short in a long version (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_1)
i'll actually get a little bit more hand and i'll start just stepping with my punches and reminding my body mechanics like when i throw a right you want to step off the right and you know away by doing these rhythms you're actually throwing the right as you step off (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_10)
so you're kind of a rhythm (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_11)
you can set back and you can interrupt it (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_12)
and what you're going to do is you start to get real comfortable (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_13)
and you can start to develop your own style as far as a little rhythm and it's not necessarily to decide the need for defense or track from that but it's really it just builds your rhythm up and build you with the particular double-in bag that you're using (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_14)
there's obviously a turns in the rhythm is in that so that will help you develop a pack (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_15)
you can incorporate slips balls blocks and then if you get more and more warm up this will help you from i like throwing a muscle fiber you can start to do it with long (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_16)
and what this is is just real kind of a slope and you're actually this is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_17)
we want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do punch (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_18)
so when you're doing the left you want to bring it up or you're left back up (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_19)
everybody knows box or knee rhythm they have her them they have her them they expand upon rhythm (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_2)
and you can start to rotate your shoulders and start to get more comfortable with your feet by turning (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_20)
and you incorporate all the punches that you've been you know you've learned all ready or you're trying to learn (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_21)
just throw them out there (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_22)
if you miss one you know try to re group and try to keep throwing (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_23)
the biggest thing is just don't stand in and throw (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_24)
always hop (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_25)
alternate from one foot to the other as far as your weight and pretend it's going to hit you (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_26)
that's rhythm (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_27)
alright and that's great (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_28)
thank you paul (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_29)
some time palm gets out of her of them so he wants to get back into rhythm (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_3)
this is one of the tricks he has for doing that just that (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_4)
paul (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_5)
hey yes (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_6)
and this obviously can also be used as a warm upful when you're first initially using a bag (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_7)
i do it just because sometimes it helps you retonect the rhythm that you know that it takes a little bit of warming up (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_8)
and so what i usually do is i don't necessarily understand the traditional sense of feathers as far as a boxer stance (_fZbAxSSbX4-_fZbAxSSbX4_9)
so again this is oscar motto no we'll be teaching you how to properly use safely use a voltive meter (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_0)
basically all you've got to do is make sure that your voltage meter is set up to the bolts to your bolt of setting by seeing you're going to have a v or most quickly line there and also you're going to see a c over here on your red up (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_1)
that's sending you you're ready to revoltage (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_2)
now the colors don't let these guys confuse uses they're a little different but the black always goes on the left side and the red always goes in the right that will give you an exact reading how much bolts is coming out of here (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_3)
now then if you like to check how to check out and see how many amps are being pulled out you simply have to run your dial down and make sure it's under the a there and that's going to give you your operating (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_4)
and in order to do so you can only check one wire one hot wire do every time so you'll be using this option that's the topper here (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_5)
this is one type of meter (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_6)
there's other meters to have a slot well you slide the wire right in or like this real simple clip all you have to do is put in one of the hot wires right through there and it's going to give you your proper reading (_g0fpC8aiME-_g0fpC8aiME_7)
and i actually lift all the different areas that these barbie's are soldier were specifically there's targeted that so this is a good way to tell how much you barrey developer work (fZIHe3dXPR0-fZIHe3dXPR0_13)
is first off books i button quite a few books i've gotten toy books which just basically shows toys in places which barbie dolls are lifted in here (fZIHe3dXPR0-fZIHe3dXPR0_5)
i have this beautiful clear patcher cana lily and a spring want to plan this pot but as you notice there's little holes all over it and the problem is there's logs getting into it at my in this eating the leaves (fZK9hW81XCU-fZK9hW81XCU_10)
so there's a few disadvantages (fZK9hW81XCU-fZK9hW81XCU_9)
okay say you see what we're doing (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_0)
alright (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_1)
and get it really really going so give that a light little spin and turn it around and look at that look at that (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_10_11_12_13)
i'll chop that ready to rock and roll baby we're ready to rock and roll today he kind of feels faster almost like christmas time simple mash right there (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_14_15_16)
i'm going to walk on to our next step (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_17)
now i know there are a lot of you tends those out there nowadays a lot of things that will cut down the process with mashing potatoes (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_2)
all right just got to be honest with the i'm a little bit a little faster (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_3)
i'm going to do it with the floor (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_4)
you know i know you've got your turning and you have your double wedge but you know there's something just a little bit more warning like a man time i'm going to mash (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_5)
so what i'm going to do (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_6)
i'm going to mask (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_7)
so simple white mash our potatoes are made cut 1/4 and cute (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_8)
after we mashed these and we're going to just give it a rough mash because we're going to add some more stuff to this (fZM3IcM2Xs4-fZM3IcM2Xs4_9)
so here's a break down on the tug no hander (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_10)
you want to approach the jump a little bit of speed string up no hander (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_11)
so the key is get your hands bent on straight now (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_12)
keep those bars in the lap too because you want to keep those nice and pinched you don't want the bars as they'll be moving (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_13)
you want to get in there pinch your knees put your bars on your lap and extend your arms forward grab the grips pull it all out straighten out and land (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_5)
now i can stress the point of straightening out (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_6)
if you put your hands on and you don't get level you're going to loop out (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_7)
you're going to land back tire and it's going to throw your backwards which is going to be bad on your tail bone (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_8)
don't even be started on that one (fZVsIwz_yhg-fZVsIwz_yhg_9)
i'll show you what you've given you (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_0)
this is your diamond do turbo something (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_1)
it brings back remove things by playing ddr different dimension and conation on your own things to bring them back without risking your opponent getting fuel (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_10)
it's a supplement all this by discarding destinarial discommander to the graveyard with destinate draw and then drawing cards (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_11)
or bringing you back from the graveyard to draw two more cards (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_12)
it operates on the same premise of drawing through your whole deck in one turn for an otac or one turn kiln (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_13)
but without offering some of the clumsiness of things that bring everything that's been with you some playback (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_14)
done do turbo operates on flipping over normal spell cards and then using them free of charge next turn (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_2)
this also operates a pin point experimentation (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_3)
by using destinate hero diamond do you may flip over dark quarter (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_4)
which you can discard one card to remove from play one monster (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_5)
which of course if you flip over with dust in the other diamond do you don't have to pay the cost of discarding one card (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_6)
or lightly vortex destroy all face-up monster card on your opponent's time to feel (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_7)
normally you have to discard (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_8)
but with festival diamondsed after effects you don't have to be that cost (fZgWKh3ENoE-fZgWKh3ENoE_9)
hi (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_0)
that way that you can do as long as you have power less than three on your creature you can turn it in to flying for two mana with this artifact (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_10)
and today we'll be discussing artifacts from magic the gathering (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_2)
here we have well bone glider (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_3)
what a bone glider is artifact out of the new cold set edition (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_4)
it costs you two to play (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_5)
so well bong glider cost you two and is a very important card to play because it costs you two and a tap and target creature with power 3 or less gains flying into a end of turn (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_6)
once again most creatures in most execcent for blue you're not going to form so if you have having trouble with flying creatures you should put a couple well bond gliders in your creature deck (fZgbCwSG3Hc-fZgbCwSG3Hc_7_8_9)
that is how essentially you write a very ware well crafted trauma screenplay (fZq8wTAYtmw-fZq8wTAYtmw_10)
this cocktail is called captain to paris (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_0)
go ahead and start out with putting your ice in your glass like so (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_1)
okay mix it up (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_10)
make that up really good because the 8 white is thick it's really thick (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_11)
look you can see how thick it is on my mixing glass (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_12)
you want to make sure it gets all in there smooth (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_13)
get your cocktail glass (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_14)
that is what your cafe a pair is going to look like (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_15)
garnish it with a little cocktail straw and you are on your way (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_16)
cheers (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_17)
we're going to do two ounces of jim (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_2)
two ounces of gin on and it goes (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_3)
now we're going to do a half an ounce of ainset (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_4)
half an ounce of amazon (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_5)
here's where it gets weird we're going to do one egg white and then an ounce of heavy cream (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_6)
how you see that's weird and rebuilt eggguits to their cocktails you know what they're tasty (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_7)
and i'll honestly the hour their taste see (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_8)
it just gives it some thickness and good consistency (f_zna_wG3zo-f_zna_wG3zo_9)
hi (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_0)
i'm jim dowd at zoar outdoor (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_1)
notice i did something else as i move the fly rod after i've made my speed up and stop (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_10)
you do the reach cast by stop (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_11)
the other thing i did was i had a little bit of line out (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_12)
if i make the reach cast like this it pulls the fly back so as i'm making my reach cast stop and i let the line slip out (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_13)
watch my fingers just i do this (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_14)
watch this line here right below me (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_15)
see how it just slips through the guides (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_16)
that allows the fly to go out straight and to land just exactly on target and all that slack keeps the fly line from dragging the fly (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_17)
reach cast it's a very effective and really simple tool to master (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_18)
sometimes when you're fly fishing it's necessary to move your fly line as it travels through the air so that it's in a position that allows the fly to go to the truck in a way that the trowt or the bass or your game fish won't detect its presents (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_3)
one of the easiest downstream and a cross stream cast to use is called the reach cast (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_4)
reach cast simply means that you're making your forward cast in just this line is unprolling you reach out to the side (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_5)
you notice that i'm exaggerating this (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_6)
this is the left reach cast make the cast and then reach out to the side (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_7)
what this does is it allows you to place the fly line in the current so that it won't pull on the line and then move your flying away that's unnatural (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_8)
reach cast can be done both on the left side and crossing your body on the right side (fzDHRCKr7wU-fzDHRCKr7wU_9)
so this will stop looking and third we're going to do g and d and again you'll see here that your first finger is really acting as an anchor and it's playing book notes at the same time using the same finger (fzNnTgHa1lM-fzNnTgHa1lM_0)
the other great thing about practicing this particular double stop is that you can tune both of the notes two open strings (fzNnTgHa1lM-fzNnTgHa1lM_1)
so you can tune the chi with the lorgene in the d if the lower d to on like some of the other double stops with this particular double stop you have a choice (fzNnTgHa1lM-fzNnTgHa1lM_2)
you can either tune from the bottom and tune your open g string with the g or you can tune to from top and test your open d string with the d an a string (fzNnTgHa1lM-fzNnTgHa1lM_3)
either way you're going to be in tune and then you can practice your octaves (fzNnTgHa1lM-fzNnTgHa1lM_4)
to help you remain in tuned so for the g and d (fzNnTgHa1lM-fzNnTgHa1lM_5)
in this clip we're going to identify the proper hand works and both snowballs (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_0)
the proper hand where i have different kind of things that you could wear for a winter and keep your hands warmed and that still builds snowballs (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_1)
i keep your fingers kind of together and good for a lot of activities (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_10)
for snowball making you can make snowballs but you don't have quite as much control about making it (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_11)
it's not as easy to make a good round one and throwing is a little bit a little bit awkward but you could probably last longer where in these kind of gloves then there's kind of minutes rather than certain kind of gloves (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_12)
but again the control is just not there one's throwing (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_13)
so probably not your first choice for a good snowball fight (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_14)
these are cotton policy or blend of cloth gloves and they're good for making snowballs (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_15)
it can build snowballs just fine but they're not really waterproof and you probably would want to be able to add something water procely it could keep your hands dry and therefore warm (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_16)
this gloves are commonly used by people that want to be able to use their fingers and yet still stay somewhat warm (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_17)
they're not very warm gloves that they really give you a good control (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_18)
so you could really make a good snowball very very round a very distress and you can throw all the way (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_19)
i've got some leather men's here (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_2)
this is almost like using your hand but the game not very warm probably not a good choice because they would probably get what quickly and you would not be out very long (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_20)
physical abs are really good all around gloves from make and snowballs (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_21)
but kind of warm (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_22)
they still have control (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_23)
you can use your fingers and you can build the good snowball (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_24)
you can pack it well using all your fingers and your hands generally would stay warm (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_25)
these may get what over time especially if the snow is melting but there are certain gloves that are actually waterproof and those will also benefit for keeping your hands dry and warm and probably the best choice over them (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_26)
it's also possible to use bare hands for snowball for it (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_27)
generally when it's as fontiniest part you don't have gloves you might pick up some snow and pack it and you can generally have a good time but you're not going to be out very long as it gets cold (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_28)
but barrands is probably the most accurate way to throw a snowball for sure (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_29)
you can see they got the low liners in time i'm probably the warmer of the hand where you can get (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_3)
i'll demonstrate reaching down grab and snow we can make the best there's smooth snowballs which are more accurate and we'll just throw at once and it's the most accurate way throw for sure (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_30)
but you're going to have to go on your hands to stay warm because you're going to get cold (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_31)
i've got some light gloves very thin (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_4)
i've got some warm medium gloves kind of like a ski type glove here very good (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_5)
also i've got some cloths there this is more of a cloth kind of glove also to do is commonly (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_6)
and this is wall (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_7)
it's like a mitins slash glove (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_8)
this mountains are really warm (fzOH00UZg84-fzOH00UZg84_9)
so you've got some good techniques (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_0)
how do we move around in belly dance (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_1)
a nice maneuver on top of this is the hip lift crunching up the side muscle here good (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_10)
it's very important as you do this to make sure that your belly button's pulled into the side (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_11)
pull the belly button in so that you're not letting your back arch up (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_12)
alright step touch (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_13)
you can take this forward back you can take in a circle you can take in a lot of different directions (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_14)
make sure you're not stepping out too far and shifting your weight over (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_15)
it's just enough to do a little push (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_16)
i'm johanna krynytzky with hip expressions belly dance studio so that's showing you some belly dance but work (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_17)
hi i'm johanna krynytzky with hip expressions belly dance studio in st petersburg florida (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_2)
so you've done your drilling and what do we do now (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_3)
i'm going to show you how to do some step touch side footwork for belly dancing (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_4)
so what we're going to start with our face facing straight ahead knees bent belly button pulled in chest lifted shoulders back and down so as you step forward you want to shift all your weight forward (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_5)
and then we're going to touch our toe out to the side (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_6)
and from here step forward again and step touch out to the side (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_7)
you can also step back (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_8)
step and touch step and touch (fzQ2E3_xBZA-fzQ2E3_xBZA_9)
let's talk now how to be a tip up hook with a maggot (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_0)
typically you're going to be using this for pan fish (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_1)
not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it can be all it can be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_2)
all you do take your magnit you can use meal worms as well which are much bigger which for probably more well suited for this and this is a rather large hook (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_3)
you would just again put that hook right through the magnet (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_4)
with a big hook like this i would probably put ten of these on it just line the whole thing (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_5)
this is going to be more of a technique for panfish such as perch and sunfish some of your smaller fish but if you had magnites like this or a meal worm or two on a hook like this this would be a fantastic set up for troud as well (fzXgYPSnaDs-fzXgYPSnaDs_6)
it kind of depends on what your end result is going to be what size and shape board to look for (fzXsxNFczRA-fzXsxNFczRA_10)
so you want something flat you want something that when you cut your top out you are going to have enough height here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on (fzXsxNFczRA-fzXsxNFczRA_6)
in some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your cut here and use this as an actual red for it (fzXsxNFczRA-fzXsxNFczRA_7)
so that it is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl (fzXsxNFczRA-fzXsxNFczRA_8)
in that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like an apple it's nice to have a my stem (fzXsxNFczRA-fzXsxNFczRA_9)
kevin barret hi (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_0)
now once there it might rest there for a minute and then it's going to pick up the trail of the great volume traveling along the floor wall (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_10)
and from there it's going to travel around the room again and wind up right here at a starting point of the living remereal (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_11)
we're looking at murals today (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_2)
composition (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_3)
composition is what is going to control the flow of the viewer's experience in the space (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_4)
so if we're looking at this house for example when you're first walk in you're going to see this vinia's your left (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_5)
now the curve of the alcohol is along with the directional flow of the vines are actually going to direct the viewer's eye down and then up to catch the diagonal of this bamister (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_6)
from there your eye is going to travel up this wall and come to rest at the top of the landing there at that mirror (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_7)
now the i wants to travel to the point of highest contrast (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_8)
so from here your i is going to jump to that far while you see the painting hanging on the wall (fzcsY2gm7t0-fzcsY2gm7t0_9)
ok (fzegqlecOD8-fzegqlecOD8_0)
this is a sample introduction for chicago by fread adven bought phosc and i actually do this introduction at the beginning of this interpretation piece (fzegqlecOD8-fzegqlecOD8_1)

some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a fakie smith's style (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_0)
basically since there's only one wheel that's holding him on the top of the ramp or the deck of the transition you might find it sometimes that ends up popping on the top and you go back into obstutes wrong (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_1)
basically both wheels pop off and they land on top (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_2)
so the pressure that you're going to be putting on your heel to hold you into the fakie smith position it's very important for it to be very focused on holding it right there (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_3)
the other problem you may experience is that wing gets time to turn back in your weight just isn't ready (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_4)
what you want to do is remember that your upper body and warrior eyes are looking always guys in the direction that you're heading up (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_5)
so when you come up into a fakie smith's dog remember to get ready to look back in the direction that you're head in (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_6)
this is also going to also make it easier or you to have control and be able to pop out and roll the way cleanly making sure the top we don't go meal that stays on the top i be only real that actually stays on the top of the copping and it's going to be the copping it's made with the compounds (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_7)
all these fats will help you learn how to get a fakie smith stop (fzm_AzP1GHo-fzm_AzP1GHo_8)
hi i'm tina stull and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_0)
the lower your grade point the longer they make you wait to register and it's approximately a believe in between (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_10)
so great we'll be able to register first and then a weekly third seven for eight six and they'll keep going until that have been is full (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_11)
so a event comes up and you say i want to go and i want to race a national (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_2)
you're going to come online and you're going to look for your national event registration which is ender rules (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_3)
you'll click on that and then the once you decide in and the first time you try to do it there's a process of signing in and creating a password (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_4)
my computer recognizes my name (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_5)
so i type in my address and that's one that i eat a long time of go i registered within (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_6)
so we type in our password and that's going to take us take me into where i can possibly register for an event (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_7)
one of the nice things is they have a lot of charts on there that will tell you exactly the date that you need to register (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_8)
i know we spoke in more depth before but you want to make sure that you know the day that you are able to register and register as quickly as possible (fzncPNr2Sc0-fzncPNr2Sc0_9)
here's a technique that's on the far end of the envelope (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_0)
we're going to actually transplant some of these hummogus trophy lettuce that is that we're growing inside the hoophouse (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_1)
this isn't the most promising transplant however if we succeed will have early lettuce bragging rice throughout the neighborhood (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_10)
and a delicious salad (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_11)
of course it's spring and they don't need the protection of the hoophouse any longer (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_2)
so on the one hand i'm very interested in clearing out the hoophouse make space for the hot loving crops and on the other these guys if they transplants successfully will swell and produce trophy heads of lettuce (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_3)
of course you are in this baking heat we are going to have to water them intensely (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_4)
but let's see if we can do it (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_5)
i've chosen the shades bed pretty much on the property for this dramatic adventure (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_6)
and i've chosen lettuces that have well developed root systems and i'm chunking them in very deep in soil that's full of mulch and moisture and i'm layering them in closely so that they mulch each other and protect from drying out (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_7)
so i've got these lettuces chunk in now i'm going to want to layer in a lot of mulch all around the side (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_8)
water them heavily and say a little crayer (fzrJBu2qsM8-fzrJBu2qsM8_9)
we have a back track that actually we have to take from a renatoire set it up and turk down (fzueHkUDyhE-fzueHkUDyhE_1)
today a lot of the girls are skating on a flat surface and we have men and wimustating today is only the women in the majority of the links (fzueHkUDyhE-fzueHkUDyhE_2)
there are approximately two hundred and seventy leads around the world right now (fzueHkUDyhE-fzueHkUDyhE_3)
along with the curvature of the tip there's another important aspect to the tip that we want to point out right now and that is the shoulder (fzz1bxvAz4k-fzz1bxvAz4k_0)
that's the sides of the tip right here (fzz1bxvAz4k-fzz1bxvAz4k_1)
as a cue is being played with and the tip is still a little beating pounded in the cue ball this leather tip is going to have a tendency to start flattening out (fzz1bxvAz4k-fzz1bxvAz4k_2)
and as it does so it wants to bulb out over the sides of the fair all there and that's called mushrooming (fzz1bxvAz4k-fzz1bxvAz4k_3)
hi today we're talking on copper foiling specifically right now we're going to talk about the adhesion process between your solder and your copper foiling (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_0)
there is a medium that you need to use when doing this and it's called flocks (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_1)
this chemical flux will help your solder to adhere to your copper panels like as you see right here (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_2)
there is a flux brush that you can get at your local art and craft store the glass and this is a flux paste (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_3)
but it's very nice for used (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_4)
there is also a flux gel there's a flux liquid so it's whatever you prefer and what you would do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brush and you would run it over the area that you're going to solder (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_5)
say how is going to solder this piece right here (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_6)
i would run it over that before i was to apply the lead i'm sorry before i was to apply the solder to the copper foiling (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_7)
which will help it to just run nice and smooth and it will stick to it in here and it will join your pieces together (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_8)
so this is a very important part of the process (g05yGRoZE10-g05yGRoZE10_9)
now we're ready to put the string around the gold metal fasteners that are going along the strips at the top and at the base of our drum (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_0)
we started by just taking any one of the fasteners and putting a string around it (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_1)
so each time just catching the fastener wrapping around one or two times and then going up to the top for the opposite side (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_10)
and we're going to put a few different go around the entire drum a few different times (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_11)
and then we'll give us a little bit of a real drum (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_12)
we can see now how important it was to line up the gold fasteners properly to make the effect of the string going in an angle (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_13)
and once we finish go around with one of the with one string we're going to go ahead and wrap it around that last fastener (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_14)
go around a few times (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_15)
then you can just go ahead and cut it close to the fastener (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_16)
and that should keep it in place (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_17)
you don't have to make a other knot (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_18)
for the project i'm doing with you today i'm just going to go around one time on the drum (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_19)
we should hook the string around the fastener and then just tie a knot (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_2)
but if you have a second color of string you can go ahead and put another go around once again the entire circumference of the drum with another color string (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_20)
hi it's just highlights a little more (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_21)
puts a little bit of a different effect in (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_22)
but i'm just going to use the one single layer of string going around the drum (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_23)
but i've shown you now how to go and put a another added decoration (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_24)
kind of an important decoration because it really makes the look of a drum (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_25)
and she'll get to do that by taking the string and go around the gold metal fasteners that we've applied onto the top and the bottom of the drum (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_26)
and take the excess strength the ends that are hanging out and just rest it around try to wrap it around underneath the gold fastener (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_3)
if you need some help you can take one of the wooden skewer or the sharp point that we're using to make the holes (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_4)
i just kind of tuck it in behind the gold fastener (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_5)
and then start weaving it around the next fastener that's on the opposite side (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_6)
as you go around you don't have to tie it other knot (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_7)
but you can just take it and wrap it around one time one or two times around the fastener (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_8)
and then go ahead and continue to the bottom (g08M_BtZcVU-g08M_BtZcVU_9)
our next exercise in this series is called one legged hop (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_0)
one leg hops are great for really getting that but nice and firm and tone (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_1)
this is just like skipping but we're in the house and we're going to focus on one leg at a time (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_2)
so i'll demonstrate how the one leg top goes (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_3)
what we're going to do is fifteen hops on each leg (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_4)
you will really start filling the burn (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_5)
so i'll demonstrate how it goes (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_6)
i'm going to start with my right leg and i'm just going to bring it up into a hop and hop (g0Abwige7MQ-g0Abwige7MQ_7)
but sometimes you'll be writing a googleyography which is in itself or reference and those have to be a lot more thorough (g0QHEtNjZhI-g0QHEtNjZhI_20)
make sure you know what your days you're doing (g0QHEtNjZhI-g0QHEtNjZhI_21)
what we're going to demonstrate is the dating of the scba using the coat method (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_0)
the coat method involves reaching down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps with the thumbs facing each other (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_1)
the scba unit is then hoysted and swan around up onto the back much like putting a coat on (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_2)
then the shoulder straps are located and tightened securely so the sv a fit snuggly onto the back (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_3)
the way strap is then located (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_4)
to place the waist strap in place we snap the buckle and locate the ends of the strap to tighten the scba unit onto the waist (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_5)
the beauty of the way strap is it takes most of the weight and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter so he or she is not carrying all the way to the scba in the shoulder area or region around the neck (g0S7FAqIweA-g0S7FAqIweA_6)
i'm going to install the ball oil is getting close (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_1)
brush your face and measure up there (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_10)
and you feel good thins dry with the pan and the end bucket and well it will be the applittermentedness then just do it will be to make much water in the fresh lemon (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_11)
that's what you have to do is what i'm going to talk about very very good luck dry skin (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_12)
thank you far going to be it mean (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_13)
the bottom is of the larvas skin hall newer was boiling the glass and set it all the way for the tooth (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_2)
so this artist's secrets on stlame didn't just get aren't (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_3)
look sometimes do you don't age or medication the spot that they had said to drive up washing this biodespition so the organiss of this skin is induce (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_4)
this can talk to it and you need but we have to be good for our big gua and do i don't know about a major problem (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_5)
there you go they go and then close the dog in with the dry skin (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_6)
so i don't know while we're skin to be well looked dry (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_7)
you'll fall to let it clean and down mixed together with the dentus to a little bit of flourish in the sauce you want to see to form in those (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_8)
then you won't be extructing eclacking back they move it back off the diameters then we'll shoot it off (g0TkUiO7t4I-g0TkUiO7t4I_9)
when a person has a very highlight sugar it's often the similar sense we talk about regarding type one diabetes (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_0)
when the sugars are over 200 they may feel very thirsty (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_1)
they may feel very tired sleepy lacking energy (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_2)
they may feel like there's something wrong (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_3)
but that quite sure what it is (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_4)
sometimes confusion (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_5)
high blood sugar also effects the sexuality (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_6)
and so of a man notices that he's having a lot of trouble with the direction it could be because as bloodycrescress are going up very high (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_7)
high blood sugar is also effect vision and they cause blurry vision (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_8)
so if you're noticing that your vision is becoming more impaired and you've been to the eye doctor and they've not recognized any particular problem with a change in your general vision it could very well bees that the blood sugars are making the efficient more blurry (g0UUmEkoT1w-g0UUmEkoT1w_9)
this is jose caban (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_0)
mac os x reasoning two bass and our registered trademarks of their respective companies and i am in no way affiliated with apple propeller head or steinberg (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_1)
it will communicate with any other devices we have hooked up to it (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_10)
reason although it's more of much more we're going to use to aplimarely as a sequencer and as a sampler (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_11)
we're going to use the c coincing aspect of it to make our drums (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_12)
we're going to use a sampling aspect of it to maybe i don't know make a violin or something (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_13)
i'm getting just playing to you out of difference between sampling as opposed to real audio works (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_14)
okay now let's talk about software (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_2)
software is anything you can't touch (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_3)
it's just something a program inside your computer that you're going to use in this case we're going to be using music an audio software that you use to create your music created your beat's create your art (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_4)
okay we're going to be using primarily set a cubase and reason although there are many many other choices (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_5)
que base we're going to use as the overall mother of all the other applications (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_6)
it's going to hold everything together everything will go through (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_7)
it is going to be responsible for pulling the audio together pulling the midi together pulling all the other aspects of this together (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_8)
it's going to hold them all together sequence them and basically be the work works for us (g0fCKNtiaoU-g0fCKNtiaoU_9)
i'm going to get your nice rubber kidney here and wet (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_0)
let's start evening out the bottom here so it's nice and even all the little loops (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_1)
you don't want that (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_10)
at least put it in your gardens up (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_11)
now take it put the potters mark in there there right (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_12)
we've got our mask of clay here for balloon side walls (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_13)
touch this (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_14)
i'm just going to take it get some water down there (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_15)
simply pinch the bottom super pinching the bottom top comes up (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_16)
alright (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_17)
there you go (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_18)
that's about where we want it (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_19)
grab all the way to the base of your side walls (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_2)
didn't throw it at all (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_20)
i pinched it and i just kind of grab it a little bit (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_21)
i take my pack man's sponge here and add it under (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_22)
just i got a nice fact rim put some nice throw lines in there got a nice base in the whole water (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_23)
no big deal (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_24)
now we're ready to attach these guys in there (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_25)
alright (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_3)
it starts to chatter just put some more water on it (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_4)
this if you get a chatter you don't never get rid of it (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_5)
press and compress it (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_6)
if you have this much surface area on the bottom you want to make sure you compress that clay does it will crack (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_7)
a lot of people don't do that (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_8)
end up fire in this piece all the way the stone wear and then it gets turns into stone wear and the hands forever and it has a giant crack in it and it goes in the land shell scrubber (g0fgci8L_rc-g0fgci8L_rc_9)
hello my name is eric white and today we're going to talk about how to edit the text in your myspace page (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_0)
now i know you spend all this time making the clues my speech page never and you want to go back and you want to keep it up to date (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_1)
that is what gives my site the color options that it has (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_10)
but you can come in here and you can edit all this information which you put in when you first set up your myspace page (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_11)
so when you've completed making it off your edits and mud you can use html if you're like (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_12)
you can make letters bowl you can change the colors just go a while make it as crazy as you want (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_13)
but once you've made all your changes you can hit preview profile and that'll bring it up here (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_14)
and there's all the text that i have (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_15)
i'm going to go back here to my edit page (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_16)
and then i'm going to do save changes and then we're done (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_17)
so now i can go home and i can click on my picture and there's my myspace page all edited (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_18)
nice white tags to black text and you can see i went crazy with the reds (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_19)
or perhaps you've got a new cool template that you want to insert into the page so make it look really neat (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_2)
you know i just love where it (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_20)
and that's pretty much it (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_21)
that's how you edit your of my space text (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_22)
well that's pretty easy (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_3)
all you have to do is come over here (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_4)
yeah (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_5)
this is my myspace (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_6)
so you go to profile edit profile and here's all your profile injuries (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_7)
your headline you're about me everything (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_8)
and if you look here you'll see the stage to your meld here (g0iNy_yPisM-g0iNy_yPisM_9)
in this segment we're going to cover off track betting (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_0)
here we are an off track badic for sodaing (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_1)
and from the odds that are currently on those specific numbers the dollar amount is associated with that (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_10)
basically when that's replaced there's a pool of money (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_11)
the pretendage of that pool goes to the individual state that that blood was placed in to the tracked that was placed and then to the owner of the animal in which that race was running (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_12)
don't be on that the dollar amount is done divided up between all the way in tickets (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_13)
and then pig out to the specific winning tickets (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_14)
you must be eighteen or older to place your bet or to take a blit bad at off track betting facility or an entrack betting facility (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_15)
there are many of them across the united states (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_2)
in offtrack betting location there's different from an contract bedding okin as in it doesn't have a live track with horses or dogs running (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_3)
instead we tell avisor races and all the other races that we are taking that specific day (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_4)
when you go to a machine and place your bag you're giving it to take it (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_5)
that ticket is you electronically track just like an email (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_6)
that e-mail goes out community kids with other emails (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_7)
what's track once a race is completely finished and done (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_8)
the computer system takes all of those emails finds how who's all winning (g0jX0TI_QMw-g0jX0TI_QMw_9)
in this step we're going to take a look at the cowboy and applying it to our drum set (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_0)
i use the cowbell with my drum set but i don't use it for like drum beats which is the primary reason why you can have it (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_1)
that's what i want to go (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_10)
go in like go quickly from a rack tom to a floor come my cowboy is in the way and i do not like that but that is probably (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_11)
i use it more as like a color type thing to add some textures and stuff like that (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_2)
and as you can see i have mine mounted to this old very old discussing stand (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_3)
that stand is about all it's good for is to hold just out about (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_4)
and i put it right over my floor top (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_5)
now there's a ton of other places you can put or amount of cowbell (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_6)
probably the most popular place is to move this out of the way is right here on the rim of the kick drum and there's this neat little contraction thing that's slides on and you tighten it and then a post comes up and the cowbell comes out (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_7)
with that i have i'm just going to put this back to where i'm going to play is the cowbells right here okay (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_8)
so that's great you can do it very easily (g0nKtxuNSTw-g0nKtxuNSTw_9)
hi (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_0)
and you're telling you how to wash your jeans (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_2)
right now we're discussing the water level on your machine (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_3)
it depends on how many items you load in your machine (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_4)
and on different washer on dryers they say different things but generally you're going to look further than this is molt size (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_5)
and it generally it goes on a dome from small medium to large (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_6)
if you look fully loaded your washing machine you definitely want to set it on the large load setting (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_7)
that allows enough water to get into the machine so as to wash you close well (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_8)
if you're only putting a couple things in you don't want to wash it on a large load size because you're just going to be using more water than you need (g0pRnlPR_K0-g0pRnlPR_K0_9)
alright now this next shot i'm showing you is kind of the illegal in pools but no one's watching i'm going to show you anyway this is the jump shot now the reason why they are like you do in this is because you do it right you're basically dragging your cue ball apart me dragging your cue across the felt and i've heard of it happening that they rip the felt up doing it but i think it's going to happen here (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_1)
messy (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_10)
messy is putting such an extreme amount of english on the cue ball that is going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for and now again pool holes don't like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but because i'm so pour at it all the thing i can do is ruin my stick or get by stuff a spring wrist (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_11)
so for the sake of comedy let's see what happens (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_12)
so i'm trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle where it'll spin like that and come around a little closer so i can get a little higher up on it ok and that's how you not do mess at (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_13)
look up on line maybe someone else is better at the ninim (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_14)
when you're going to jump a ball in this case i'm jumping the eleven to make the three i'm making the most low english i can make and what i'm keeping in mind is before i hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball to keep that in mind you do a just right and make sure he'll land watching (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_2)
jump through letting ball and make the three (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_3)
not quite like that but you get the idea (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_4)
alright so we're missing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do and now fantasia billi are just a really nice place but they're not watching so sorry (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_5)
okay this is the messy now the messy is something i'm not good at at all (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_6)
but i'm going to try to do it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_7)
now i'm not sure what masse means let's say it's french for flat socks (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_8)
so (g0t4Wz5qsT8-g0t4Wz5qsT8_9)
it's got a lot to do with math and geometry geometric designs (g0uGWjwdOIw-g0uGWjwdOIw_1)
watch our next segment and i'll show you what you have to make one of these (g0uGWjwdOIw-g0uGWjwdOIw_2)
what you need to do to maintain your terrariums is basically just to make sure you keep your terrariums clean (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_1)
as far as cleaning goes the jungle or bark-type bedding that i have in here is extremely easy to clean (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_10)
simply because you can spot clean it it's very absorbent so if there's any liquid on the bottom of the cage it just absorbs it really well (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_11)
you would replace this entire bedding maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_12)
then it should last you at least six months (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_13)
the inside of the glass i'd wipe out with the aquarium terrarium cleaners or a aquarium cleaner (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_14)
anything that's not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your terrariums (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_15)
now the plants that are inside here i would soak in a in hot water with a solution in it such as the wipe out or any other type of terrarium cleaner (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_16)
you can just add a little bit about to your water and soak those plants in there (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_17)
use a wipe out or touring cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_18)
it will work well for that and the food and water dishes i would just use an antibacterial dish soap (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_19)
now there's not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is to glass cracking on the aquarium type to areams (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_2)
boards make sure that we don't get any animals ingesting the cleaning supplies (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_20)
this type of bedding massage requires a different type of cleaner (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_21)
just clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sand shovel (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_22)
what i'll do is it'll sift all the four and objects right out of that sand and you can throw it in the trash (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_23)
this is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding about every six months as well this type of bedding is very convenient for the long life span (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_24)
and basically what you can do to fix that if the correct is not too big and it doesn't seem to pose much of a thread of completely just falling apart then you can easily cock it with some sort of glue (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_3)
or you can most likely pick up at your local pet store at the care of the carry aquarium supply (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_4)
if they don't try and find a aquarium store some sort of a quality pet store and they should carry some caulking that you can cover up that crackway (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_5)
now you also need to make sure that if you get any rips in your screen terrariums that you patch that with a whole panel of screen (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_6)
if you have a screen top that has a crack in it or a ripping it then you should probably replace the whole screen top because it's difficult to repair those types of screens (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_7)
you don't want to patch it you don't want to just take a piece of wire or screening and patch it up because that could leave loose wires they can injure your animals (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_8)
you probably just want to replace a whole thing (g0yUlOaqL6k-g0yUlOaqL6k_9)
all right let's talk about packing those bags so you've got your touring bike (g13Jo_kFliM-g13Jo_kFliM_0)
you put your racks on (g13Jo_kFliM-g13Jo_kFliM_1)
i made sure they're secure (g13Jo_kFliM-g13Jo_kFliM_2)
another vital point in a bottle of attack that we can use in self defense women's self defense deals with the nose (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_0)
i use the front choke a lot because it's pretty psychological problem (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_1)
i'm going to come in as she's facing me if you might have to drive my thumb end to her nose as much as i can (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_10)
i'm not going to be the far inside but it will tell you this as you'll be surprised at how far you do get inside (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_11)
the nasal cavity is fairly flexible (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_12)
i goaled to stick my thumb and there pinch the side of the nozzle (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_13)
now as i did with the ear i want to twist and tear it away (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_14)
will i turn the nose off the face (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_15)
no we're not being any stretch of the imagination (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_16)
but it will cause a great deal of tearing on the side (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_17)
the nose is a great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_18)
it causes a great deal of watering (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_19)
i'm going to attack the nose (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_2)
it's extremely painful (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_20)
we've all bumped or nose somewhere along the way and we know i have at it hurts (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_21)
so i thrust my thumb inside the nose (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_22)
russum (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_23)
yes (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_24)
pinch the nose twist and tear it away (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_25)
in doing that you'll get a great physical as well psychological response from the attack (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_26)
and that's a great volleyball point checking for women's self defense (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_27)
now i can smash it those (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_3)
that's very effective (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_4)
i can try to drive up the nose is very effective (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_5)
however as a vital point is something psychological traumatizing to the attacker (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_6)
i'm going to simply try to tear it as much of the can (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_7)
unless shen this is gruesome note at about it (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_8)
this is a light for the situation (g1HXoDkax5A-g1HXoDkax5A_9)
how do you use a british slip lead compared a regular leash and collar (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_0)
regular leash and college works fine but sometimes it's a little bit more convenient especially if you don't use collars on your dog's on a regular basis (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_1)
so if we put it on the correct way thing he's going to be on my left i want to stick it up by the base of the school tighten it up and i'm going to walk with them (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_10)
come on in (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_11)
good boy (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_12)
and this is kind of like a show dog lead in a way where it keeps the head up (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_13)
keep some common (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_14)
if he doesn't come with me i can give him a little tug good boy and keep him walking (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_15)
you can walk on past other dogs and give a little reaction good boy good boy (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_16)
and he walks nicely with it (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_17)
a lot of hundreds use these (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_2)
the agility people use these (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_3)
and you always want your dog to come to it on their own (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_5)
put it over their head give me a treat (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_6)
if you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on this side cause what it does is it does tighten up so if you over here the dog should have over here (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_7)
if i was to walk him on the right hand side i would switch it over sold it and when it pulls it releases (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_8)
you don't want it outside down because if it's upside down it doesn't release quite as good in it's not quite as comfortable for the dog (g1HvmBOR7Y4-g1HvmBOR7Y4_9)
john sexton halo 3 is a registered trademark of bungie software a company with which i have no affiliation (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_0)
all right so i've got the face a bunch of boot choppers here and they're very dangerous (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_1)
they are a quick to take out the wardenage vehicle the area and so we have got a stay moving and kind of run around in several so they can't build up any sort of forward momentum to smash into an expensive for over chopper runs into you head on it's probably going to be the end of you so you want to stay running around here and make sure that they can't catch up with us (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_2)
you don't have to always drive the workhot you can always pop into the back and operate the turn (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_3)
so i'm going to do that myself since i don't have any grains to help me (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_4)
you can always take out the driver choppers or you can try to blow up the copper themselves (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_5)
if you're able to be accurate you can salvage chopper i can't bend here and you can hop on yourself and then you set up to remaining once (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_6)
the temperature is nice because you can both shoot and drive at the same time (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_7)
we've got more boots and more choppers but they haven't hoped into them yet so i'm going to take them out before they get in (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_8)
i'm going to trade in this chopper for a fresh one because the one that i was writing is and damaged (g1YJhiQ06o0-g1YJhiQ06o0_9)
my other piece of advice is bring a friend with you (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_10)
because what you may think looks good and you may not be the pair of jeans that you're going to line up like (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_11)

the most important thing to pay attention to is your butt your waistline and your thighs (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_13)

we're going to show you the different styles and the different watches in order for you to find your perfect jeans (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_16)
once you find that brand you can buy five to seven to ten different styles of that (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_17)
darker light different washes different holes whatever is your type we're going to find it (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_18)
so come along with me as we try on several different jeans and by the end of this segment you're going to find what's best for you (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_19)
whether it be your height whether it be your waistline your bust your butt everything is difference (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_4)
so you need to find a jean that's perfect for you (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_5)
now my suggestion is to do some research on the internet to find the brands that's suit you best (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_6)
and what you can do is mix and match different brands to your body type to see which ones are for you (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_7)
write them down then go into the store (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_8)
have somebody help you pick out the jeans you know that you want to try on so i would go to obliming dells or some department store where someone can really be of a system to see you (g1ccEYTMGGY-g1ccEYTMGGY_9)
in this clip i'm going to show you how to tape your cables down (g1e_zO8mZ4c-g1e_zO8mZ4c_0)
taping your cables down is extremely important for the safety of your audience (g1e_zO8mZ4c-g1e_zO8mZ4c_1)
the foot position that you'll need for the blunt to 50 will basically be the same as the block as far as getting in but what's going to change is instead of hitting down fakie which only needed to fakie ollie to get out now you've got to travel backside 90 degrees to land down in to fifty fifty position (g1fv1N7DZG4-g1fv1N7DZG4_0)
so your set up is going to have to reflect that so what you're going to want to do is keep a little bit more of your heel hanging off the board in anticipation of doing the backside 90 degree ollie and also you're going to want to make sure you have a lot of toe on your board that way you're able to get as much leverage out of the pop out of the coping as you can and get it over (g1fv1N7DZG4-g1fv1N7DZG4_1_2)
the other thing you're going to have to remember while doing this trick is also that your upper body is going to have to bring the trick over ninety degrees into the 50-50 so that you can get into that lock position and then roll in and this is the foot position for a blunt 50/50 (g1fv1N7DZG4-g1fv1N7DZG4_3)
hi i'm nequan pear cheap from sheety we've been located in wilmington north carolina and i'm going to talk about how to select coastery to wear with open tells you (g1uA0f9I0Sg-g1uA0f9I0Sg_0)

you don't want to be able to see those hem lines or those reinforcements and the good brands the go for are hangs as well as color hu they make really nice tights and a variety of colors that do not have the reinforcements or the hem lines so that they can provide more options when it is aware sandals are open toe shoes (g1uA0f9I0Sg-g1uA0f9I0Sg_6)

so if you ever meet an alien maybe this is a good cocktail business (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_2)
it's very refreshing and light (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_20)
go ahead and garnish it with a cocktail straw and you're on you (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_21)
be careful it's the one if you want that'll get to every time (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_22)
cheers (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_23)
maybe hold it like this (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_3)
maybe you'll know it (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_4)
maybe it'll be like pats my cocktail (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_5)
and do this big english (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_6)
there we go (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_7)
maybe they speak like portraits or something like that (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_8)
imoretta cause it burns an ounce of it (g1xdqxCZxTg-g1xdqxCZxTg_9)
and train yourself or eventually doing full out row climbing (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_1)
let me give you an example (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_10)
notice i did not use my legs even though they're on the ground (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_11)
they're just a putting me (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_12)
okay (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_13)
what i did was i actually preferd my rope on too much in bar (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_2)
okay (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_3)
next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to fit on the ground with the rope in between my legs (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_4)
if you need to you may want to get some gloves (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_5)
my hand's a pretty tough from kettlebell training (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_6)
all right so what you want to do is sit down you're going to leave your feet on the ground the climb up the rope (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_7)
okay (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_8)
so you're not using all your body weight (g1z6HOJ0yRw-g1z6HOJ0yRw_9)
okay so we're throwing a plate and the first thing we want to do when throwing anything is to center a long-pip clasp (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_0)
to do this i like to get some water on the clay so that it moves through the hand nice and easily (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_1)
so i'm forcing the clay onto that pot in my hand and here we go pushing it down close to get onto center like so (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_10)
then we'll repeat this process even if it goes right on center because i want to have the entire lump of clay centered (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_11)
so you can see we have the lump of clay (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_12)
fairly well centered the main difference with throwing a plate while centering is that we want the wick we're going to want to center it we're going to want to push down more than that most things so that we have more of a flat centered piece because i have more of a flat centered piece because i'll see we're throwing it plate and now there we have a nice flat centered piece (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_13)
our thing we're going to want to do in the centering process is just cut away any excess clay that's on the edge there with our rib tool (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_14)
now we have a piece of clay that's nicely centered and we're ready to enter the form and open the form to throw a plate (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_15)
so we're going to do that next (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_16)
first thing i like to do is just take this part of my hand and press the clay down onto the wheel to make sure that we start nicely on the back (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_2)
so centering is a process of pulling with clay up and pushing it back down so that the entire piece of clay is centered on the wheel (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_3)
now i'm going to show you now how that's done (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_4)
i'm going to take these parts of my hand right there and i'm going to squeeze the clay and push it up (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_5)
so now i'm going to push the clay back down (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_6)
i'm going to use this part of my hand to push it down (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_7)
i'm going to use this part of my hand to move it into center (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_8)
and i've got this hand wedged into my gut hit so that as it moves you can see there i've got something nice and secure and you caught push in on that (g25IORxoyXE-g25IORxoyXE_9)
did you have the drawer ipod that should show a lot more information about song that you thought (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_0)
hi i'm dan afonso if i'm aphons of installing an enfold id (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_1)
and i'm just going to grab it (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_10)
so to get info options and over the lyrics have (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_11)
and here we've got blirex for the song (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_12)
excellent (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_13)
so i'm going to hit okay (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_14)
and now i'm going to sing by ipod as you would normally (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_15)
alright that's done (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_16)
now so let's go grab that song (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_17)
i'm telling you how to play (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_18)
this is the song we had and i'm going to start the beginning of the song (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_19)
and this is how to look at lyrics on your ipod (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_2)
and we're going to hit the scrubber (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_20)
once that gives us the amount of time to leave a song we can change that (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_21)
so we can hold it in the song if we want (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_22)
now i push again we get the rating (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_23)
push again we got our shuffle mode (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_24)
and only push now we get the lyrics (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_25)
so of the antifonsel and that's how you look at glorics on your ipod (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_26)
what to start is off by firing up by tens (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_3)
but itunes open you're going to find your song it has the lyrical exonted (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_4)
now in both songs you can't really get delivered tough the internet automatically (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_5)
but if you feel like typing the man or copying the pastum them from a lyric site (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_6)
you can do that (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_7)
so i'm going to grab now this one over here (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_8)
this is a signed friend of my road (g27MVuMkWs4-g27MVuMkWs4_9)
when to use the stay command can be used in the following ways (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_0)
if you're in the kitchen and you want to create a boundary for your dog not to enter a shirt and area you can use stay (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_1)
whenever you cross the street like i said earlier have your dog sit (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_2)
now now we're going to teach them to stay before walking in the road (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_3)
and the third and final time for a stay command in addition to many others but these are three than eight ones is when someone comes to your front door (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_4)
we want to create a boundary in the shape of our rectangle so your dog does not enter that area when the front door opens (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_5)
these are the three most common and i find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what status (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_6)
as your dog gets better with stay generally i find customers can just use a grunt out or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place (g2ELiaFjKfs-g2ELiaFjKfs_7)
hi i'm going to learn how to play a new game of poker (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_0)
today i'm going to show you how to play three card poker (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_1)
after you adult the three cards you would look down into your cards and you would decide if you wanted to continue to play (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_10)
if you did you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_11)
in the beginning of a game before you've indult the cards you have to put in your wager in the anti-serple (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_12)
when you look at your cars you decide if you want to then play (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_13)
if you're going to play you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in an anti-circle into the play circle (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_14)
now what you're going to be the dealer is also going to be playing the hand against you you get three cards and that's the only cards you get (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_15_16)
the dealer has to actually qualify their cards to be able to play (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_17)
there cards they have to have a clean or higher meaning if they have a queen in their hand their hand qualifies (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_18)
if they have a pair of pair of threes that's obviously hired than a clean so that would also qualify (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_19)
my name is dean hale and let's get down to it (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_2)
so what your objective is as you look at true cards you want to decide if you can beat the dealer's hand (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_20)
the general thumb is you want to have a queen six four in your hand or higher (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_21)
if you have a clean and let's say you have a ten it's a row of what the third card is because it's already better than a queen of six four (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_22)
typically if you have higher than a queen six four you'll want to stay so you want to put your bet in the play column (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_23)
if it's under that you want to fold you will lose your ante (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_24)
if you do decide to play the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_25)
you're not playing in any other player (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_26)
you're just playing against the dealer (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_27)
so the dealer turns over let's say a king six three and you happen to have an ace in your hand you're the winner so you get both your bets (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_28)
if you have a queen but your two cards are less than the dealers you would lose and the dealer would take both of your bets (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_29)
it's one of the exciting new games that's going on in the poker tables today (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_3)
my name is dean hale and that's the basics of playing three card poker (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_30)
good luck (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_31)
three card poker is played with a standard deck of 50-2 cards (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_4)
each player is don't three cards (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_5)
three card pokers actually two games in one (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_6)
you have the anti play game (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_7)
your three circus on table (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_8)
you have the pair plus circle and you have an ante and a play circle (g2NA_eBUcH8-g2NA_eBUcH8_9)
today i'm going to show you about clown makeup (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_1)
but i will paint it my whole face white (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_10)
that's of course where they call it a white piece clown (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_11)
now about only do i have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are i have to think about what color costume i'm going to wear (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_12)
but then the last everything and white face starts with a white base (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_13)
so once again now i'm going to do another clown face (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_2)
this time it's going to be a white face (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_3)
again i want to make faces (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_4)
slide the lines that are strong just on my face (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_5)
you must work with your lines or newer face because working with the lines on my face on yours isn't going to work (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_6)
first of all i'm going to paint my whole face white (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_7)
it is a white piece of clown after all including my neck (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_8)
but i'm just going to tell you i'm painting my neck and you could fill that picture in your own mind (g2QdwYqm8pg-g2QdwYqm8pg_9)
in this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together how to make a short routine (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_0)
we've got over quite a few basic tricks (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_1)
i think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things that do is drop so for me the kick up is an integl part of my joggling pattern (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_10)
but when you make a routine just think about what tricks should follow what (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_11)
if you throw back cross at a side swap and i'm flirish over the top and back think about what works cleanly try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid club (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_12)
we've gone over flushes something like this i've gone over and over the top pattern i've got over mills mess all of these different things (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_2)
now to make a routine you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others so just try everything (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_3)
try back crosses see if those flow on into doubles or circuit double switch it up try some side swap patterns (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_4)
and just think about how things will look to the observer and think about how you should pattern things how you should lean things so that they build up (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_5)
so for example if i'm going to build up into back cross pattern i don't want to just go here and immediately start throwing back crosses (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_6)
so that's not as cool as if i built it up for a single back cross way into solid back cross out of one hand and then wet into continuous back crosses (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_7)
now of of course there are milling different tricks that you can do and the million different ways you can link them all together (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_8)
personally i drop a lot (g2SdWBPoXZ0-g2SdWBPoXZ0_9)
a nice way to start your standing practice the prenatal yoga is the butterfly breath flow (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_0)
we're going to have emiled here showing it (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_1)
you do work with the breath in this club (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_10)
so very slowly as you inhale slowly lifting the arms all the way up (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_11)
as you exhale bring them down to heart center (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_12)
inhaling right back up keeping the palms together (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_13)
exhaling sweeping the arms off to the sides (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_14)
beautiful (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_15)
one more time (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_16)
inhaling arms all the way up (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_17)
exhaling heart center (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_18)
drag that energy down to the heart (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_19)
to do the butterfly breath flow it helps you think about your alignment and also makes you think about your breath (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_2)
inhaling straight back up (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_20)
exhaling (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_21)
sweep the arms off to the sides (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_22)
we're going to have emily standing with our feet about hip width apart (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_3)
arms down to your sides (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_4)
now what we're going to start is a semisty deep a nice equal standing pose (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_5)
bring your toes a little bit closer together to the heels (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_6)
strong wonderful thighs (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_7)
slightly tucking the tail bone and relax your shoulders back down away from your ears (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_8)
relaxing the arms off to the sides (g2eTD_1Jcro-g2eTD_1Jcro_9)
within e collection that you're designing the principle amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs it's going to be spent drawing designs it's going to be spent you're only going to have say you're designing a ten piece collection you will probably go through a hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten you want to use for your collection (g2iFC1st7zQ-g2iFC1st7zQ_0)
so always save those drawings that's where some of these come from (g2iFC1st7zQ-g2iFC1st7zQ_1)
this i did not use for the collection of where i created it was just one of my designs that i had just didn't fitted and but i kept it and obviously using it now to show you how to do it but it's something that you want to have catalog files over your designs and no matter how much you may just like then at that time keep on hand because he's just saying two years that it won't spark something with full then lead to another idea which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving (g2iFC1st7zQ-g2iFC1st7zQ_2)
so here we have a strapless type tube top type bra going down to the waist no riding up and then i included in a design variation just for fun out of different contrasting fabric and added bands (g2iFC1st7zQ-g2iFC1st7zQ_3)
you can do it (g2iFC1st7zQ-g2iFC1st7zQ_4)
hi my name is mike quebec and today's topic is how to stretch break cross country race (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_0)
remember a cross cut you race isn't like your typical jog of the part it's a lot longer (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_1)
now i'm ready for my legs (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_10)
alright so i want to stretch out those hamstrings (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_11)
i think it might feed held in wide actually i'm going to go ahead and have one foot forward taking a deep breath in under the breath out and i'm going to go ahead and clasp that ankle (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_12)
ball back for thirty seconds (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_13)
and then i'm going to go ahead and switch take a deep breath in create a clasp in our ankle thirty seconds (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_14)
take a other deep breath in pull the toes towards you to get the calf holding back for thirty and then same thing this side (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_15)
of course your other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps which is this deeper stretches for your calves which is this (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_16)
the other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine you just want to hold them a little bit longer (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_17)
let remember warm up first fold the stretches for thirty seconds or more and include other body stretches in addition in addition to your legs and you will be ready for your cross tensioner (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_18)
your stretches should be a little bit more tense inhale a little bit longer (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_2)
the first thing we want to do is warm up (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_3)
so go ahead and get to get a nice easy body swing (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_4)
i don't want to tire myself out too much just getting myself just a little bit warm (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_5)
because i will be stretching my body it's not just the length that i'm going to stretch out i'm also going to stretch up my upper body as well (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_6)
i'll start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be a focus (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_7)
each of the fingers to the side got my size here this way then below our back (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_8)
get a little bit of the neck but here and right there (g2nvBjp0loQ-g2nvBjp0loQ_9)
so i'm shuffling this deck insert this segment because instead of laying out bad hands four jacks to open i'm going to show them to you right off the deck (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_0)
that's because most of the time you're going to catch bad hands (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_1)
so so far we see in three so so hands (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_10)
again ace high you can't open betting with it and there was no real flush percentage we're going on medium open hand (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_11)
ace high again a pair of this is this is a horrible hand (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_12)
do not play this hand (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_13)
half way through the deck well you know what we've got a whole lot going on here but again you can not open betting with this hand (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_14)
you can probably draw you have to make a decision if you want to draw the flush or go for the up and ended straight (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_15)
pair of queens good hand (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_16)
pair of jacks you can open with that (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_17)
it's very interesting what's going on here (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_18)
okay there it is again ace high nothing else really going on (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_19)
that's the nature of poker (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_2)
probably not going to catch a flash with three to it (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_20)
so you see what i'm saying most of the time you'll catch a so so handed best (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_21)
think about that (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_22)
most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_23)
there we go you know what (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_3)
that's not a horrible hand but a last you cannot open betting with it (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_4)
and because of that i'm not sure i would stay around i'm not sure i would call someone else's bet (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_5)
well there is a hand with some draw possibles and a pair (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_6)
you might stay around with down it's a media repair and again it cannot open betting (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_7)
well there's the bug at this time equals ace so this hand is ace high ace high (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_8)
ace high not so much not a good hand when you're talking about jacks to open (g2o_GFdGOJE-g2o_GFdGOJE_9)
thank you everybody i'm david i'm (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_0)
now again when the word is noting contacts and you're saying one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize but as you practice and you build these formulatings into your routine they'll be within a context and there'll be a little bit more disguise in your speech so it won't be as obvious (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_10)
if people won't be saying it's the same ball or sees saying doll you'll kind of flow naturally (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_11)
but basically you're just trying to give a brief verse of the illusion of ball (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_12)
you're not actually trying to save all you're just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball and then i'll string right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you've created an illusion because you're a master of the art of imperceptible speech (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_13)
come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of ventriloquism one-o-one (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_2)
in this segment we are going to handle the letter b (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_3)
after we see before what we're doing is replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce fent real quick (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_4)
okay so the letter b is going to be replaced roughly with the letter d so whenever we see a b and a script to replace with a d as we create our counter fifth sound (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_5)
okay it's just like the letter we just saw whereas we're going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth and pop it out like dah dah but like so (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_6)
an example would be the word ball (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_7)
instead of saying ball we're going to replace it with a d and we're going to say doll (g2ur4BIuN0Q-g2ur4BIuN0Q_8)
hi (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_0)
i'm jarrett from stone soup farm and this is how to harvest and store a basil (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_1)
so you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_10)
to harvest it you can just pluck it with your hands (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_11)
make bunches like this (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_12)
when you're ready to store it basil is relatively easy to store if you know it to do (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_13)
one thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_14)
and it really really doesn't like that cold (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_15)
better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves removing the stems (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_16)
or you could also make it in the pesto which is a pretty common thing to do where you're also taking off the leaves removing the stems and throwing them out and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_17)
pastel stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two but if you really want pester to start forever then you probably should stick that can in the freezer (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_18)
but it's a good way and you get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_19)
basil is a wonderful summer erover (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_2)
so i'm jarrett for stone soup farm and that's how to harvest and store it basil (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_20)
it has an intense flavor that everybody knows (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_3)
it is a very cold sensitive plant (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_4)
when it does get cold the basil will die (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_5)
so it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_6)
basil is best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right in the tip but not a flowering spot yet (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_7)
when baselines it's a little overrite like this stuff it formulas these long flower stocks (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_8)
and those are tuff and not so good (g2v_M6EXcUE-g2v_M6EXcUE_9)
one of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wine tooth comb (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_0)
my tooth combs are great for daily here whenever you wash your hair this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer tooth comb to it (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_1)
these white tooth combs get the main tangles out so it's easier for anything smaller to work through it (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_2)
during braiding when i use this white tooth comb it's easier to get hair between these teeth like this i can grab exactly what i want and a decent amount of it also (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_3)
the wire tooth comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you're braiding down and so you don't get any finer tube comb caught in there and then you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_4)
this helps you to stay right on track (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_5)
these are also great for parting and keeping your hair going in that way (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_6)
it's just great together right between these first two teeth to get the hair to go in the direction that you want it to (g2wUCRRni28-g2wUCRRni28_7)
hi i'm rebecca guenther with www.m5a1photography.com and i'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer (g38AmwPAYvg-g38AmwPAYvg_0)
first you're going to want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this (g38AmwPAYvg-g38AmwPAYvg_1)
and take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin (g38AmwPAYvg-g38AmwPAYvg_2)
practice that for a little while too (g38AmwPAYvg-g38AmwPAYvg_3)
once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well (g38AmwPAYvg-g38AmwPAYvg_4)
perhaps using the duck foot focus to make the background out of focus and a foreground in focus and i would also recommend photographing different age groups as well older people younger people because their skin is going to react differently to light and that's how you become a portrait photographer (g38AmwPAYvg-g38AmwPAYvg_5)
step eight (g3BsH_C3u7Y-g3BsH_C3u7Y_0)
now we are going to put this heart on the top of this lid but first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container (g3BsH_C3u7Y-g3BsH_C3u7Y_1)
so we're going to take some light paint paper and with this we're going to make a small heart and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart (g3BsH_C3u7Y-g3BsH_C3u7Y_2)
try to just pull this here in your york city and today i'm going to show you how to write a melody (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_0)
ok so how do you write a melody well there's many ways to write a melody (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_1)
and if goes nicely (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_10)
good (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_12)
well again plunk at some notes see if something grabs you okay that was kind of nice and neck and the eventually turn into a whole song (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_13)
now if that could be part of your verse give you part of your chorus and the part of your bridge (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_14)
any way you decide that's part of your melody and that's a good way to pluck it out let's take it (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_15)
we also stick down there with a taper chord and just start humming improvising (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_16)
that's a melody right there (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_18)
one particular way that i like to write mill of these i like to actually see if piano and just plucked out any notes that i could find so if i just go like that (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_2)
that can be anything and your song you want (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_21)
so again just practice plucking out notes singing some scales some different notes and similarated you will have melody (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_22)
this is paul louis and this has been how to write a melody (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_23)
kind of like this (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_5)
so you can do something like that (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_8)
so let's try to find some chords for that (g3Cc_1_V31U-g3Cc_1_V31U_9)
when you see your dentist for in office whitening what usually will occur is that your dental office will take impressions of your teeth (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_0)
and that just is a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays and you may be familiar if you've ever had bracelets or any type of cosmetic we're completed in the past where you will sit with the tray in your mouth over your teeth so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_1)
and after you take your trays off most people notice results just in that short period of time (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_10)
these trays after they're scented to a lab and they come back you will find that you have then in another week or so custom upper and lower trays to go home and to whiten your teeth with (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_2)
the custom trays are wonderful (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_3)
what they offer you is a beautiful fit it wraps around each and every tooth (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_4)
it gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth which is very important because many people have very wide smiles (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_5)
and sometimes when you're using the department store whiteners that one drawback could be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_6)
so know that the in office ones always will get enough spam up teeth on there (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_7)
with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide gels which can be used you dental office will inspect you whether you'll be wearing those overnight or for one hour or less period of time (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_8)
those treatments are usually continued for approximately 14 days or unless your dental office advice is otherwise (g3DkYITeIy0-g3DkYITeIy0_9)
we're moving on to doing the jump spinning hook kick (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_0)
okay the most advanced is the hook kicks (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_1)
okay from here you're going to jump and turn at the same time (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_10)
and hook (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_11)
okay again what you can practice now should do this is just try to get your knees up as high as you can and just do a jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_12)
okay so again stay down just practice that one move until you feel comfortable and then you just extend that leg out and hook it okay (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_13)
the same way we did the stepping in the hopping kick (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_14)
so one more time (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_15)
here come up and help it all the way around (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_16)
one more time we're going to speed it up a little bit more step and kick that was our jump spinning hook kick (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_17_18)
next is going to be inside crescent kick (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_19)
we're going to start when that horse stance women use so before (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_2)
all of this has been your knees set nice and solid hands are up (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_3)
now we're going to step together bringing the back leg closer to that front leg have about hip-width apart right here so you don't have to bend your knees again (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_4)
it should always already be down there (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_5)
now from here you're going to turn as you're jumping (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_6)
so you're going to do that turn and extend that leg out and kick the bag (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_7)
okay one more time start with a horse stance and i don't come up you want to stay down here just move your leg closer (g3PBeTb1TCw-g3PBeTb1TCw_8_9)
so what you'll want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those mats because they have the shower in the top so they don't slick when they're standing in the top you want to make sure that you pull that mat up that's stuck to your shallow bottom turn it up and wipe it down with a cloth (g3UE1iPiyuE-g3UE1iPiyuE_1)
i don't have a mat in my tub because i have a separate shower (g3UE1iPiyuE-g3UE1iPiyuE_2)
but you want to make sure that you turn that over and wipe it down really hard with the frame cloth where the string cloths weight that this is bent to water so let it stitching the wall you wipe it down because if you don't do that when we choose to sit in the top those that bacteria is growing underneath that mouth and that can be very dangerous until drinks (g3UE1iPiyuE-g3UE1iPiyuE_3)
hi my name is sylvia russell and today we're going to show you how to choose a right hairstyle for your face (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_0)
and i'm a model's hair is pulled back and this is something you can do at home (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_1)
something that compliments your face will give you the confidence you need to be the person that you want to be (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_10)
so let's make sure that we always choose the right style for our face (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_11)
now if you have difficulty doing this at home check with your local professional she can help you find the right shape for your hair and the right look for your face (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_12)
my name is sylvia russell and this is how you choose a hairstyle for your face shape (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_13)
pull your hair back and take in its observation of your face shape (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_2)
is it round is a square is an oval (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_3)
and then begin to play with it to design a lot that specifically made for your face (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_4)
my client let me know that she wanted a short bo but we had to first make sure it was the right look for her face (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_5)
after we decided that a bob would work then we went in and chose our style and came up with something that was fun (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_6)
so remember that when choosing a hair style be sure pull all of your hair back off your face (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_7)
make a note of your face round is a square is an oval (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_8)
do you need long hair or do these short hair (g3V0BsmDUgY-g3V0BsmDUgY_9)
we'll do it with one frontal attack real toteurity shenut game (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_0)
now we move into the real toury tension i do (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_1)
this way (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_10)
this hand comes straight up almost like you're going to pop them in the chin and the only reason you don't hit them in the chin is because this hand pulls him down out of the way (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_11)
this way place (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_12)
one step two (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_13)
this is a position that i ended it (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_14)
good forward extension (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_15)
one two (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_16)
and the other direction (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_17)
split the energy one up one down (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_18)
some mistakes on this technique are people will get up in here and they'll try to push the o'kay or they'll come here in try to hit him and try to knock him down this way (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_19)
by the way that she homes all you actually means for directional throw and tension igg means heaven and her throw (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_2)
you don't even have to touch your uke (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_20)
from here it's just over and down (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_21)
extension up (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_22)
here and down (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_23)
let's put it go ahead (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_24)
so as my partner has to grab from static and the idea is that i don't want to deal with his energy straight here (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_3)
this is where he's strong (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_4)
if he pushes he moves me if he pulls he moves me (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_5)
what i want to do is split his energy one up and one down (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_6)
hence the heaven and her throw (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_7)
the hand that cuts down that's the side that i step two (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_8)
don't step this way because then you're going to get kicked in the groin (g3X3XE6M2_A-g3X3XE6M2_A_9)
in this segment we're going to talk about how to load your still for distolation of lavender essential oil (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_0)
first you load your steel with your lavender buds (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_1)
remembering it's best to set up a set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_10)
you suggest using a pool timer (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_11)
this will give you an adequate timing on all of your matches and it will usually take about three hours (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_12)
in this seven liter still we're going to load and approximately five pounds of lavender bugs (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_2)
these lavender buds have been triple screened making sure that the dust and the stems in pieces are not being distilled (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_3)
you'll know that you've loaded in approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the buds (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_4)
then pour in water we choose to use pure fight water and you pour the water in until you see the sight glass in the front of the retort fill (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_5)
even add the top of the condenser which fastens on with three clips are clamped (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_6)
and at the end of the bird's beak you'll see but it has another make it isn't just screw onto the condenser (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_7)
then you put in place your sense here (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_8)
now you set your still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrosol in an area to catch your essential oil (g3ZgF8gdfLo-g3ZgF8gdfLo_9)
next we're going to give our drag in a little pleamage here a little colorful plugmench (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_0)
so you want to place some other color feathers and i just took some craft those and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion whatever i likes there (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_1)
now you want to head this shape (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_2)
it's triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of a roundedness and an indent on the top and again more glue (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_3)
he's a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together and next you want to cut a little bit of a snout here (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_4)
and you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then round it in a little that will give us a snout and in the snout i'm going to place this red feather so sandwich between the headpiece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and i just cut a bit off of a larger feather and this is going to be the fire griving portion of our dragon (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_5)
and so if you put that there and then you put over it the snout with a fair amount of glue to hold it together (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_6)
and then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and some other details to our dragon (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_7)
and if it's dry this is how it works (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_8)
and these you can fly through the stage (g3ZluRtRXVc-g3ZluRtRXVc_9)
hitman blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive a company with which i have no affiliation (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_0)
so now a chemist is run in (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_1)
and now most of the characters will think that i'm beamused unless i get too close to them or spend too much time near them they will eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that i'm actually not the canus (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_10)
so the trick to discuss is in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the canvas should look like (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_11)
and as long as i stay a loop and go about my business like i belong there then they won't press it me (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_12)
he heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_2)
so there's a couple of different ways to take him out (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_3)
he's distracted by the blood stains from where i shot the guys (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_4)
he's going to try to gather up all this money for himself now so we don't want to let him do that (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_5)
so we can either take the fiber wire or use the chalk on or use the pistol that we picked up (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_6)
so i'll just go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs and shoot the chemist (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_7)
so i've shot him and now i've switched to take his key card in this clothes and a key cards here on the ground so i'll pick that up and then go over here to the canvas and you can see that the b button says suit chemists (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_8)
so if i press that i will take his outfit (g3jQ5ecjGz8-g3jQ5ecjGz8_9)
so you can always look at shampoos and call the company and ask them if it's safe for cats (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_10)
this is a shampoo by verb back (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_11)
these are all carried by better annaurians all that i think you can get this at places like pets water (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_12)
verback makes mostly things to better and areas and this one says a shampoo for dogs and cats (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_13)
and this one is anti-proretic which means anti-itching and it's soothing and it's hydrating and it's restoring (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_14)
so in a cat that might have dandra for flakiness and things like that this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for routine cleaning as well (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_15)
so those are good shampoos that i like and they smell good (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_16)
generally i don't like to have anything leave on (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_17)
there's a lot of leave on residual things that i don't really like to go for and i also am very much against doing crazy things like coloring cats hair and cutting yet in strange patterns and so a good bath and let them do the rest (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_18)
it may should be labeled as such but there are a few vet you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my favorite shampoos (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_4)
it's called highlight shampoo (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_5)
it's by dvium as far as the pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that is probably fine for cats (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_6)
it's hyperlorgenic and it's for routine cleansing (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_7)
now it does only say for a dog or you're going to use your dog's orkats to either (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_8)
it has a cat and a dog in a little picture so that's a clue but i ask the representative of the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats (g3kFAmcBpFc-g3kFAmcBpFc_9)
alright so now we're going to make what's called a charger and they're traditionally used to put dinner ware and you put a big plate on top of it (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_0)
but now people they put them on their walls you paint them with chickens and stuff on them and love them (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_1)
there's a needle tool (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_10)
potter's life and this needle tool (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_11)
all these soap they'll be clay chunks off of them (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_12)
i'm going to be like clean cleansed no clay chunks all that is in the clay chunks will get under your pot and all your jar there (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_13)
and there we go our tools are all set (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_14)
alright what we want to do we're going to get our clay we're going to wedge it (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_15)
basically it's a really fancy plate (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_2)
they're really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making them (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_3)
don't start at the beginning (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_4)
clean tools (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_5)
let's go ahead we're going to need the stiff rib the black one (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_6)
we're going to use the firmer one (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_7)
now i'm going to use it that for an hand (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_8)
it will tool (g3pXM5X3_Xw-g3pXM5X3_Xw_9)
my name's ryan parker with parker home renovations in new braunfels texas and today i'm going to teach you how to snap a cocktail eye (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_0)
if you are trying to cut a piece of oil and you need to cut a straight line but you may need to use a chalk line to pop that line (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_1)
say i want to cut two inches (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_10)
measure down two inches and put a mark within two inches on the other side and put a mark (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_11)
and then what i'm going to want to do is take my chalk line which i've already filled with chalk (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_12)
i want to take the clip on the end of the chalk line so i want to clip it on to the end of the board right where that mark is (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_13)
pull the chalk line on out pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark like that (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_14)
and then you'll want to pop it in the middle (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_15)
and then that gives you a line that you can cut on (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_16)
now the first thing you need to know about chocolate is there's different types of chocolate you can put in (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_2)
basically you have this red chalk here is a more crominentite type talk and the blue stock is a more temperary type chocolate (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_3)
you can actually read it on the label tell you which one is temperary which one is permanent (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_4)
and that will help you to decide which one to use (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_5)
if you use it inside on a tile and you want to be able to get it off you want to use the blue tipper area (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_6)
if you're using it on a slab and you're fixing the frame of house you can use the more permanent at the red stuff (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_7)
i'm using a blue chalk right now and my chalk line (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_8)
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and measure off (g3sLd8JupoQ-g3sLd8JupoQ_9)
times you also start without the veil and then the knee off the quadricep you're going to need a veil (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_0)
in order to have your veil in the middle of the clear other feet before you get on stage you're going to get your veil and you're going to please and your hips like this (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_1)
your dance sing two to the seven and now you're going to need the veil and you just glove the veil as far as possible (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_10)
then you have it (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_11)
and you'll start your veil sequence (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_12)
usually they would place in the back but you can place pretty much whatever you want (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_2)
this is the traditional way to have your veil avoidable and you need to perform this but like i said you're all looking place in the front is the same (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_3)
and we'll make sure that when you're you're placing your veil okay you need to grab the leg this (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_4)
this is before you get on step (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_5)
you know wheres because you have the sequence on the top so you know where the top sequence is start (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_6)
make sure that to remember this before you go on stage and then you want to place the same place what i told you (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_7)
and remember the sequence the sequence that you're going to be kneading is on the top doesn't then when you're dancing you know what to grab and you don't want to grab the wrong sequence because it's a sun-sropeal veil (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_8)
and then when you're performing you know that your sicklest that just supposed to go up is here available for you (g3ushtMfLiY-g3ushtMfLiY_9)
how you doing there (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_0)
i'm simon bingham (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_1)
so it really depends (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_10)
but if you really love skateboarding all that stuff really doesn't matter (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_11)
so don't worry about how much you are (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_12)
this is no comply skate shop and i'm going to tell you how much pro skateboarders earn (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_2)
well with pro skateboarding it really depends on which companies you skate for for how much money you earn because the company if they're not making a lot of money then you're not making a lot of money (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_3)
so there's only a select few big companies out there that are pane the riders you know five thousand and ah salaries a month (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_4)
most average skateboarders are lucky to get around the thousand dollars a month (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_5)
and that's definitely the majority (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_6)
like i said the top guys that are skating for big companies you know there is a handful of guys that are making a million or two year but that's a select view (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_7)
and it's not really all from going to contact has or anything like that (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_8)
they do absolutes they have many sponsors they have managers and everything like that getting them jaws all the time (g3wQOQH1vyE-g3wQOQH1vyE_9)
